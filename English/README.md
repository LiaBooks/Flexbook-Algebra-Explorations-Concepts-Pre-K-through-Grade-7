## 1.0 CK-12 Algebra Explorations Concepts, Pre-Kindergarten

<article>

Introduction
------------

In these concepts, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of algebra and will practice your problem solving skills. There are five concepts, and each one focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. You will focus on describing, solving, and checking your thinking.

### 1.1 Picture Graphs

<article>

What do you see in the picture graph below? Can you say who has more or less? In this Concept, we will practice looking at picture graphs and describing what we see by counting and using comparison words like **more** and **less**.

![0](media/1.png "Figure 1: ### Picture Graphs ")

When looking at a picture graph like the one above we see different stacks of objects. In order to describe what we see we can say what object it is. We can also count how many objects are in each stack. We can also compare the stacks and say which one has more or less.

#### Looking at Picture Graphs 

1. Look at this picture graph:

![0](media/2.png "Figure 2: _What do you see?_")

You should see some red balloons and some yellow balloons. The red balloons belong to Bob. It says Bob under the stack of red balloons. The yellow balloons are Ann's. It says Ann under the stack of yellow balloons.

_Who has more balloons?_

You should see that there are more red balloons. Bob has more balloons because Bob has the red balloons.

_Who has less balloons?_

You should see that there are less yellow balloons. Ann has less balloons because Ann has the yellow balloons.

_How many red balloons does Bob have?_

Try counting starting from the top balloon. Put your finger on each balloon as you count. You should count 3 red balloons.

_How many yellow balloons does Ann have?_

Try counting starting from the top balloon. Put your finger on each balloon as you count. You should count 1 yellow balloon.

2. Look at this picture graph:

![0](media/3.png "Figure 3: _What do you see?_")

You should see two stacks of yoyos. One stack has red yoyos. The other stack has blue yoyos. The red yoyos belong to Rich. The blue yoyos belong to Nan.

_How many red yoyos belong to Rich?_

Try counting starting from the top yoyo. Put your finger on each yoyo as you count. You should count 4 red yoyos.

_How many blue yoyos belong to Nan?_

Try counting starting from the top yoyo. Put your finger on each yoyo as you count. You should count 4 blue yoyos.

_Rich and Nan have the same number of yoyos. How can you tell by looking at the stacks?_

You should notice that the two stacks are the same height. That's why Rich and Nan have the same number of yoyos.

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

![0](media/4.png "Figure 4: In this picture you should see two stacks of paint brushes. One stack has green paint brushes. The other stack has black paint brushes. Brad has 4 black paint brushes and Tom has 2 green paint brushes. Brad has more paint brushes. Tom has less paint brushes.")

### Vocabulary

To have **_more_** means to have a greater amount. To have **_less_** means to have a smaller amount. In the picture below, there are **_more_** red balloons. There are **_less_** yellow balloons.

![0](media/5.png "Figure 5: ### Examples")

#### Example 1

What do you see? Who has the most crayons? Who has the least crayons? How many crayons does each person have?

![0](media/6.png)

\[Figure 6\] 

There are three stacks of crayons. One stack has purple crayons. One stack has red crayons. One stack has brown crayons. Al has the most crayons. He has 5 red crayons. Larry has the least crayons. Larry has 1 brown crayon. Sue has 3 purple crayons.

#### Example 2

What do you see? Who has the most beach balls? How many beach balls does each person have? Do any stacks have the same number of beach balls? How do you know?

![0](media/7.png)

\[Figure 7\] 

There are three stacks of beach balls. One stack has pink beach balls. One stack has blue beach balls. One stack has yellow beach balls. Nina has the most beach balls. Nina has 5 yellow beach balls. Ron and Sonia have the same number of beach balls. Ron has pink beach balls and Sonia has blue beach balls. They each have 2 beach balls. Their stacks are the same height.

#### Example 3

What do you see? Who has the most puzzles? Who has the least puzzles? How many puzzles does each person have?

![0](media/8.png)

\[Figure 8\] 

There are three names, but only two stacks of puzzles. Sandy has the most puzzles. She has 4 puzzles. Eric has the least puzzles, he has 0 puzzles. The other stack of puzzles belongs to Greg. Greg has 2 puzzles.

### Review 

For problems 1, 2, and 3: Look at the picture. What do you see? Who has the most? Who has the least? Do any people have the same number?

### 1.2 Train Cars

<article>

Do you notice a pattern in the train cars below? Can you fill in the missing cars? In this section , we will practice describing the patterns we see in pictures and completing the patterns.

![0](media/12.png "Figure 1: ### Train Cars ")

When looking at a picture like the picture of the train cars above, sometimes we can look for a pattern. When looking for a pattern, read the colors aloud and see if you notice any set of colors happening more than once. After you figure out the pattern, you can fill in the blank cars so that they match the pattern.

#### Patterns 

1. Look at the train cars below and describe what you see. Do you notice a pattern?

![0](media/13.png "Figure 2: You should notice that the colors Red, Blue, Yellow repeat three times. There is also a Red car at the end before the caboose.")

_What colors should the blank train cars be?_

In order to fit with the pattern, the blank train cars should be Red, Blue, and then Yellow. Check that the pattern sounds right by naming all the colors of the cars aloud.

2. Look at the train cars below and describe what you see. Do you notice a pattern?

![0](media/14.png "Figure 3: You should notice that the colors Red, Yellow, Yellow repeat three times. There is also a Red car at the end after the last two Yellow cars.")

_What colors should the blank train cars be?_

In order to fit with the pattern, the blank train cars should be Yellow, Yellow, and then Red. Check that the pattern sounds right by naming all the colors of the cars aloud.

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

![0](media/15.png "Figure 4: In this set of train cars, the colors Blue, Red, Red, Yellow are repeated. In order to fit with the pattern, the three blank cars should be Yellow, Red, Red.")

### Vocabulary

One type of **_pattern_** is when certain characteristics (like color) get repeated many times in the same order. The train cars below have a pattern in their colors. The colors Red, Blue, and then Yellow repeat three times.

![0](media/16.png "Figure 5: ### Examples ")

For each set of train cars below, describe the pattern. Then, fill in the colors for the blank cars. Finally, read the colors of all the cars aloud to check that your solution sounds right.

#### Example 1

![0](media/17.png)

\[Figure 6\] 

In this set of train cars, the colors Yellow, Yellow, Blue, Blue are repeated. In order to fit with the pattern, the blank cars should be Yellow, Yellow, Blue.

#### Example 2

![0](media/18.png)

\[Figure 7\] 

In this set of train cars, the colors Red, Blue, Blue, Yellow are repeated. In order to fit with the pattern, the blank cars should be Red, Blue, Blue.

#### Example 3

![0](media/19.png "Figure 8: In this set of train cars, the colors Red, Red, Yellow, Blue are repeated. In order to fit with the pattern, the blank cars should be Red, Yellow, Red, Red, Yellow.")

### Review 

For each set of train cars below, describe the pattern. Then, fill in the colors for the blank cars. Finally, read the colors of all the cars aloud to check that your solution sounds right.

### 1.3 Teeter Tottering

<article>

Can you tell which animal is heavier in the picture below? Can you tell which animal is lighter? In this section, we will practice describing what we see and identifying what is heavier and what is lighter.

![0](media/25.png "Figure 1: ### Teeter Tottering ")

When looking at a picture of a teeter totter like the picture above, we will often see that one side is on the ground and one side is not. This tells us which object on the teeter totter is heavier and which object is lighter. The side of the teeter totter that is on the ground will have the heavier object on it. The side of the teeter totter that is not on the ground will have the lighter object on it.

#### Describing Pictures 

1. Look at the picture below and describe what you see:

![0](media/26.png "Figure 2: You should notice two animals on a teeter totter. One rabbit and one kitty. The kitty's name is Katey. The rabbit's name is Robbie.")

_Who is heavier?_

You should notice that Robbie is heavier.

_How can you tell from the picture?_

You can tell because the rabbit’s side is lower because he weighs more.

2. Look at the picture below and describe what you see:

![0](media/27.png "Figure 3: You should notice two animals on a teeter totter. One is a squirrel and one is a rabbit. The squirrel is named Sam. The rabbit is named Robbie.")

_These two animals weigh the same. How can you tell from the picture?_

You can tell because the teeter totter is level. Neither of the sides are lower than the other.

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

![0](media/28.png "Figure 4: In this picture we see a teeter totter with Geoffrey the giraffe and Lester the lion. We can see that Geoffrey is heavier. The giraffe's side is lower because he weighs more. We can see that Lester is lighter. The lion's side is higher because he weighs less.")

### Vocabulary

One object is **_heavier_** than another object if it weighs more. One object is **_lighter_** than another object if it weighs less. We can compare the weights of objects by looking at them on a teeter totter.

### Examples 

For each teeter totter below, describe what you see. Then, identify which animal is heavier, which animal is lighter, or if the two animals weigh the same amount. Explain how you can tell from the picture.

#### Example 1

![0](media/29.png "Figure 5: You should see 2 animals on a teeter totter: an otter and a camel. The otter is named Orly and the camel is named Cassie. Cassie is heavier because the camel is at the bottom of the teeter totter. Orly is lighter because the otter is at the top of the teeter totter.")

#### Example 2

![0](media/30.png "Figure 6: You should see 2 animals on a teeter totter: a baby elephant and a donkey. The elephant is named Ellie and the donkey is named Derrick. Ellie and Derrick weigh the same. We can tell because the teeter totter is level.")

#### Example 3

![0](media/31.png "Figure 7: You should see 2 animals on a teeter totter: a hippopotamus and an aardvark. The hippopotamus is named Harry and the aardvark is named Andrea. Andrea is lighter. We can tell because the aardvark is at the top of the teeter totter. Harry is heavier. We can tell because the hippopotamus is at the bottom of the teeter totter.")

### Review 

For each teeter totter below, describe what you see. Then, identify which animal is heavier, which animal is lighter, or if the two animals weigh the same amount. Explain how you can tell from the picture.

1.  ![0](media/32.png)\[Figure 8\]
2.  ![0](media/33.png)\[Figure 9\]
3.  ![0](media/34.png)\[Figure 10\]
4.  ![0](media/35.png)\[Figure 11\]
5.  Draw your own picture of a teeter totter that shows two animals weighing the same amount.
6.  Draw your own picture of a teeter totter that shows one animal weighing more than another animal. Circle the animal that is heavier.

### 1.4 Packing Bags

<article>

Can you describe what you see in the picture below? What if you put the same shapes that are in the filled bag into the empty bags? How many of each shape would you now have? In this section, we will practice describing what we see and counting shapes.

![0](media/36.png "Figure 1: ### Packing Bags ")

When looking at bags like in the picture above, we can see that one bag is filled and the other bags are empty. We can fill the empty bags the same way as the filled bag. Then, we can count to see how many of each shape we have in total.

1. Look _at the picture below. What do you see?_

![0](media/37.png "Figure 2: You should notice 2 bags. One bag has shapes in it and the other bag is empty. The bag with the shapes in it has 2 circles and 1 triangle.")

_The bag with shapes in it is Ann’s bag. Use your shape tiles. Put 1 triangle into the empty bag. Put 2 circles into the empty bag. Now, count the shapes. How many circles in all? How many triangles in all?_

You should have 4 circles in all and 2 triangles in all.

2. Look _at the picture below. What do you see?_

![0](media/38.png "Figure 3: You should notice 2 bags. One bag has shapes in it and the other bag is empty. The bag with the shapes in it has 2 triangles, 1 circle, and 1 square.")

_The bag with the shapes in it is Ted’s bag. Use your shape tiles. Put 2 triangles into the empty bag. Put 1 circle into the empty bag. Put 1 square into the empty bag. Count the shapes. How many triangles in all? How many circles in all? How many squares in all?_

You should have 4 triangles in all, 2 circles in all, and 2 squares in all.

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

![0](media/39.png "Figure 4: You should notice 3 bags. One bag is Bob's bag and it has 1 circle and 2 squares in it. The other two bags are empty. If you put 2 squares into each empty bag and 1 circle into each empty bag you will have 6 squares in all and 3 circles in all.")

### Vocabulary

This is a **_circle:_** ![0](media/40.png "Figure 5: This is a **_square:_** ![0](media/41.png)")

\[Figure 6\]

This is a **_triangle:_** ![0](media/42.png "Figure 7: ### Examples ")

For each set of bags below, describe what you see. Then, fill the empty bag(s) with the same shapes that are in the filled bag. Last, count how many of each shape you have in all.

#### Example 1

You should notice 3 bags. One bag has 2 square, 2 triangles, and 1 circle. The other 2 bags are empty. If you put 2 squares, 2 triangles, and 1 circle in each empty bag, you will have 6 squares in all, 6 triangles in all, and 3 circles in all.



![0](media/43.png)

\[Figure 8\] 

#### Example 2

You should notice 3 bags. One bag has 3 circles, 1 triangle, and 1 square. The other 2 bags are empty. If you put 3 circles, 1 triangle, and 1 square into each empty bag, you will have 9 circles in all, 3 triangles in all, and 3 squares in all.



![0](media/44.png "Figure 9: #### Example 3")

You should notice 4 bags. One bag has 2 triangles, 1 circle, and 2 squares. The other 3 bags are empty. If you put 2 triangles, 1 circle, and 2 squares into each empty bag, you will have 8 triangles in all, 4 circles in all, and 8 squares in all.

### 1.5 Using Clues

<article>

Can you match a description or a clue with a picture? If you know that Mr. Rippledandy is one of the pictures below and Mr. Rippledandy has a hat, can you say who Mr. Rippledandy might be? In this section, we will practice using clues to identify characters.

![0](media/50.png "Figure 1: ### Using Clues ")

When looking at a set of similar pictures like the faces above, we need clues to figure out which picture is correct. For each clue, see which pictures match the clue. The correct picture will be the one that matches all of the clues.

1. Look at the pictures below. Peter Palooka's pumpkin has a triangle nose. Which pumpkins match this clue?

![0](media/51.png "Figure 2: You should notice that pumpkins B and C both have a triangle nose. We know that Peter Palooka’s pumpkin is not pumpkin A.")

Peter’s pumpkin has a mouth. Which pumpkin is Peter Palooka’s pumpkin?

Pumpkin B must be Peter Palooka's pumpkin because pumpkin B is the only pumpkin with both a triangle nose and a mouth.

2. Look at the pictures below. Mr. Liketysplitity’s Umbrella has 2 circles. Which umbrellas might be Mr. Liketysplitity’s?

![0](media/52.png "Figure 3: You should notice that umbrellas A and B have 2 circles. We know that Mr. Liketysplitity’s umbrella is not umbrella C.")

Mr. Liketysplitity’s umbrella has one triangle. Which umbrella is Mr. Liketysplitity’s umbrella?

Umbrella A must be Mr. Liketysplitity’s umbrella because umbrella A is the only umbrella with both 2 circles and one triangle.

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

![0](media/53.png "Figure 4: Because Mr. Rippledandy has a hat, he must be Face A or Face C. If we also know that Mr. Rippledandy is wearing eyeglasses then we know that Mr. Rippledandy must be Face C.")

### Vocabulary

A **clue** is a piece of information that helps us to solve a puzzle or mystery. When we use clues, we are using deductive reasoning.

### Examples 

#### Example 1

Mr. Bobbity’s Book has 1 snake on the cover. His book has 3 spiders on the cover. Which book is Mr. Bobbity’s book?

![0](media/54.png "Figure 5: Book A")

#### Example 2

Anna’s Balloon has one dot. Her balloon has 4 stars. Which balloon is Anna’s balloon?

![0](media/55.png "Figure 6: Balloon B")

#### Example 3

Mrs. Starglitter’s Purse has 2 stripes. Her purse has 5 squares. Which purse is Mrs. Starglitter’s purse?

![0](media/56.png "Figure 7: Purse C")

### Review 

1. Mrs. Sillysue’s Mask has a yellow nose. Her mask has a green mouth. Which mask is Mrs. Sillysue's mask?

![0](media/57.png "Figure 8: 2. Jellybean's Shoes each have two eyes. Her shoes don't have teeth. Which shoes are Jellybean's shoes?")

![0](media/58.png "Figure 9: 3. Mr. Candybob’s Mask has a blue tooth. His mask has a green face. Which mask is Mr. Candybob's mask?")

## 2.0 CK-12 Algebra Explorations Concepts, Kindergarten

<article>

Introduction
------------

In these concepts, you will continue to develop the basic concepts of algebra and will practice your problem solving skills. There are six concepts, and each one focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. You will focus on describing, solving, and checking your thinking.

### 2.1 Number Towers

<article>

What do you notice in the number tower below? What if you wanted to move the numbers in the cloud to the number tower so that the numbers were in order? In this section, we will practice using deductive reasoning to fill in missing numbers.

![0](media/62.png "Figure 1: ### Number Towers ")

When looking at a number tower and cloud like the ones above, we can fill in the number tower by moving numbers from the cloud to the tower. We want the numbers in order so the least number is on the top and the greatest number is on the bottom. We can start at the top and find the smallest number and put it at the top of the number tower under the 3. Continue until we have filled in the whole number tower.

1. Use the numbers in the clouds. Fill in cubes with numbers. The least number is on the top and the greatest is on the bottom.

![0](media/63.png "Figure 2: ![0](media/64.png)")

\[Figure 3\]

2. Use the numbers in the clouds. Fill in cubes with numbers. The least number is on the top and the greatest is on the bottom.

![0](media/65.png "Figure 4: ![0](media/66.png)")

\[Figure 5\]

3. Use the numbers in the clouds. Fill in cubes with numbers. The least number is on the top and the greatest is on the bottom.

![0](media/67.png "Figure 6: ![0](media/68.png)")

\[Figure 7\]

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

![0](media/69.png "Figure 8: If we fill in the cubes with numbers so that the least number is on the top and the greatest is on the bottom, this is the solution:")

![0](media/70.png "Figure 9: ### Vocabulary")

The **_least number_** is the smallest number. The **_greatest number_** is the biggest number. In the set of numbers {1, 6, 3, 9, 7}, 1 is the least number and 9 is the greatest number.

### Examples 

Use the numbers in the clouds. Fill in cubes with numbers. The least number is on the top and the greatest is on the bottom.

#### Example 1

![0](media/71.png "Figure 10: ![0](media/72.png)")

### 2.2 Straws and Glasses

<article>

Can you draw 5 ![0](media/82.png) in each glass? Then can you count to figure out how many straws in all? Can you count by 5s? In this section, we will practice drawing straws and then counting by 2s or 5s to figure out how many we have.

![0](media/83.png)

### Straws and Glasses 

Once you have drawn in straws like in the problem above, there are many ways to count how many we have. Since there are 5 straws in each glass, one way to count all of the straws is to count by 5s. If we put 2 straws in each glass, we could count all of the straws by counting by 2s.

1. Look at the picture below:

![0](media/84.png)

_Draw 2_ ![0](media/85.png)_in the glass._

Your picture should look like this: ![0](media/86.png)

_Count the straws. How many straws in all?_

You should see that there are 2 straws in all.

2. Look at the picture below:

![0](media/87.png)

_Draw 2_ ![0](media/88.png)_in each glass._

Your picture should look like this: ![0](media/89.png)

_Count the straws. How many straws in all?_

You should see that there are 4 straws in all. We can count by 2s ("2, 4") to get our answer.

3. Look at the picture below:

![0](media/90.png)

_Draw 2_ ![0](media/91.png)_in each glass._

Your picture should look like this: ![0](media/92.png)

_Count the straws. How many straws in all?_

You should see that there are 8 straws in all. We can count by 2s ("2, 4, 6, 8") to get our answer.

#### Earlier Concept Problem Revisited

![0](media/93.png)

Once we draw 5 straws in each glass, our glasses look like this.

![0](media/94.png)

We can count by 5s to figure out how many straws there are in all. When we count like 5s it sounds like "5, 10, 15." There are 15 straws in all.

### Vocabulary

**_Counting by 2s_** is when you count objects in groups of 2. When you count this way, it sounds like "2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...". **_Counting by 5s_** is when you count objects in groups of 5. When you count this way, it sounds like "5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...".

### Examples 

Draw 5 ![0](media/95.png) in each glass. Count the straws. How many straws in all?

#### Example 1

![0](media/96.png)

### 2.3 Teeter Totter

<article>

Can you tell which animals weigh the same? Can you tell which animal weighs the least? In this section, we will look at sets of teeter totters with animals on them and compare the weights of the animals.

![0](media/109.png "Figure 1: ### Teeter Totter ")

When looking at a set of teeter totters like the one above, we learn different things from each picture. If the teeter totter is level, then we know that those two animals weigh the same. If the teeter totter is not level, then we know that the side lower to the ground has the animal that weighs more. We can combine this information to compare the weights of all three animals.

1. Look at the picture below. What do you see?

![0](media/110.png "Figure 2: You should see a squirrel, a bat, and a lion. The squirrel is named Cynthia. The bat is named Bob. The lion is named Leonard.")

_Which two animals weigh the same?_

You should see that the teeter totter is level in Picture A, so Cynthia and Bob weigh the same.

_Which animal weighs more in Picture B? How can you tell from the picture?_

You should notice that Leonard the lion weighs more because the lion side of the teeter totter is lower.

_Who weighs the most?_

Leonard the lion because the squirrel and the bat weigh the same. The lion weighs more than the squirrel, so he also weighs more than the bat. The lion weighs the most.

2. Look at the picture below. What do you see?

![0](media/111.png "Figure 3: You should see a cat, a dog, and a raccoon. The cat is named Kit. The dog is named Donald. The raccoon is named Rafael.")

_Which picture shows that Kit the cat weighs less than Donald the dog? How can you tell from the picture?_

We can see that Kit weighs less than Donald from picture B. This is because Donald the dog is on the bottom of the teeter totter and Kit the cat is on the higher side.

_Which picture shows that Rafael the Raccoon weighs the same as Donald the Dog? How can you tell from the picture?_

We can see that Rafael weighs the same as Donald from picture A because the teeter totter is not tipped.

_Who weighs the least? How did you decide?_

Kit the cat because the cat weighs less than the dog. Since the raccoon and the dog weigh the same, the cat also weighs less than the raccoon.

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

You should see Roosevelt the rhinoceros, Donald the deer and Bernice the bear on teeter totters. We can see the Roosevelt the rhinoceros weighs less than Bernice the bear from picture A. We can see that Roosevelt the rhinoceros weighs the same as Donald the deer from picture B. Roosevelt the rhinoceros weighs the least because he weighs less than Bernice the bear and Bernice the bear weighs the same as Donald the deer. So Roosevelt the rhinoceros weighs less than Donald the deer. Roosevelt weighs the least.

### Vocabulary

To **_weigh more_** means to be **_heavier_**. To **_weigh less_** means to be **_lighter_**. We can compare the weights of objects by looking at them on a teeter totter.

### Examples

![0](media/112.png "Figure 4: #### Example 1")

Describe what you see in the picture.

We see Horace the hippo, Ollie the otter and Wally the walrus on teeter totters. 

#### Example 2

Which two animals weigh the same? Which picture shows that they weigh the same?

Wally the walrus and Horace the hippo, which we see in picture B. 

#### Example 3

Which animal weighs less than Horace the hippo? How can you tell from the picture?

Ollie the otter because Ollie's side of the teeter totter is higher.

#### Example 4

Who weighs the least? How can you tell?

Ollie the otter since the walrus weighs the same as the hippo, and the hippo weighs more than the otter, then the walrus weighs more than the otter. So the otter weighs the least.

### 2.5 Sports Balls

<article>

The graph below shows the number of tennis balls that four different people have. Can you tell who has the most tennis balls? Can you tell who has the least tennis balls? Can you use the graph to figure out how many tennis balls each person has? In this earlier, we will learn how to interpret picture graphs.

![0](media/155.png "Figure 1: ### Sports Balls ")

In order to answer questions like the ones above about who has greatest number of sports balls and who has the least number of sports balls we can use the picture graph. The person with the greatest number of sports balls will have the highest stack. The person with the least number of sports balls will have the shortest stack. In order to figure out exactly how many sports balls each person has, we can count the number of sports balls in their stack.

1. Look at the picture graph below. This picture graph shows four students and the ping pong balls they have. The circles stand for ping pong balls. The students are Todd, Dina, Matt, Carol.

![0](media/156.png "Figure 2: _Matt has the least number of ping pong balls. How many ping pong balls does Matt have? Color Matt’s ping pong balls blue._")

You should see that Matt has 1 ping pong ball by counting the number of balls in his stack.

_How can you tell from the graph that Matt has the least number of ping pong balls?_

You can tell because his stack is the shortest.

_Todd and Carol have the same number of ping pong balls. How many ping pong balls do they each have? Color their ping pong balls yellow._

You should see that Todd and Carol each have 3 ping pong balls.

_How can you tell from the graph that Todd and Carol have the same number of ping pong balls?_

You can tell because their stacks are the same height.

_Dina has the greatest number of ping pong balls. How many ping pong balls does she have? Color Dina’s ping pong balls red._

You should see that Dina has 5 ping pong balls.

_How can you tell from the graph that Dina has the greatest number of ping pong balls?_

You can tell because her stack is the highest. Here is a graph that has been colored.

![0](media/157.png "Figure 3: 2. Look at the picture graph below. This picture graph shows four students and the ping pong balls they have. The circles stand for ping pong balls. The students are Jeff, Roz, Pedro, Cindy.")

![0](media/158.png "Figure 4: _How many basketballs does Roz have?_")

Roz has zero basketballs. You can tell because there are no circles above her name.

_Who has the greatest number of basketballs? How many basketballs does that person have? Color this person's basketballs red_

Jeff has the greatest number of basketballs. He has 6 basketballs.

_Pedro has 2 less basketballs than Jeff. How many basketballs does Pedro have? Color Pedro’s basketballs green._

Pedro has 4 basketballs.

_Cindy has 2 more basketballs than Roz. How many basketballs does Cindy have? Color Cindy’s basketballs yellow._

Cindy has 2 basketballs. Here is a graph that has been colored.

![0](media/159.png "Figure 5: #### Earlier Problem Revisited")

![0](media/160.png "Figure 6: This picture graph shows four students and the tennis balls they have. The circles stand for tennis balls. The student's names are Ella, Ann, Bob, Sam.")

From looking at the graph we can see that Bob has the greatest number of tennis balls because his stack is the highest. Bob has 6 tennis balls. We will color Bob’s tennis balls green.

We can also tell from looking at the graph that Ann has the least number of tennis balls because her stack is the shortest. Ann has 2 tennis balls. We will color Ann's tennis balls yellow.

Sam has one more tennis ball than Ann, so Sam has 3 tennis balls. We will color Sam's tennis balls blue.

Ella has 5 tennis balls. We will color Ella's tennis balls red.

Here is what the graph looks like once it has been colored.

![0](media/161.png "Figure 7: ### Vocabulary")

To have **_more_** means to have a greater amount. The person with the **_most_** has the greatest amount. To have **_less_** means to have a smaller amount. To have the **_least_** means to have the smallest amount. In the picture below, Bob has the most tennis balls and Ann has the least tennis balls.

![0](media/162.png "Figure 8: ### Examples ")

This picture graph shows four students and the golf balls they have. The circles stand for golf balls. The students are Ang, Beth, Don, Eric.

![0](media/163.png "Figure 9: #### Example 1")

Who has the greatest number of golf balls? How many golf balls does this person have? Color this person's golf balls red.

Eric has the greatest number of golf balls. Eric has 8 golf balls.

#### Example 2

Don has 6 less golf balls than Eric. How many golf balls does Don have? Color Don’s golf balls yellow.

Don has 2 golf balls. 

#### Example 3

**T O O O T**

### Peculiar Patterns

When identifying a letter pattern like the one above, the first thing we should do is describe anything we notice. For example, each line in the pattern has one more letter. Also, each line has a T at the beginning and at the end. Then, try to figure out what is changing from one line to the next.

1. Complete the next two rows.

Write the letters.

**K**

**K L**

**K L M**

**K** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**K** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Each row in the pattern has one more letter. The letters are in the sequence of the alphabet. The fourth row should be KLMN. The fifth row should be KLMNO.

2. Complete the next two rows.

Write the letters.

**C D**

**C D E**

**C D E F**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Each row in the pattern has one more letter. The rows always start with C, and then the letters are in the order of the alphabet. The fourth row should be CDEFG. The fifth row should be CDEFGH. 

3. Complete the next two rows.

Write the letters.

**F G H**

**F G H I**

**F G H I J**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Each row in the pattern has one more letter. The rows always start with F, and then the letters are in the order of the alphabet. The fourth row should be FGHIJK. The fifth row should be FGHIJKL.

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

We saw the following pattern in the Concept section.

**T M T**

**T N N T**

**T O O O T**

In this pattern, each row has one more letter. Also, each row begins and ends with a T. In the middle of the T's, the number of letters goes up by 1 for each row. The letters in the middle of the T's are the next letter in the alphabet, starting with M.

The fourth row should be TPPPPT. The fifth row should be TQQQQQT.

### 3.1 Balance the Pans

<article>

You have lots of these boxes. If you wanted to make the pans balance, which boxes will you use? Can you solve this problem in more than one way?

![0](media/167.png "Figure 1: ### Balance the Pans ")

In order to balance pans like the one above, use the problem solving steps to help you.

* First, **describe** what you see and what information you are given.
* Next, identify what **your job** is and what you are trying to solve. In all of these problems, your job will be to figure out which boxes to put in the pan. You want to make sure that the weight of each pan is the same.
* Third, make a **plan** for how you will solve.
* Fourth, **solve** the problem.
* Last, **check** your answer by making sure that the combinations of boxes you found add up to the amount that you needed.

For the problem above, since the right side weighs 9 pounds, you want to make sure the left side will also weigh 9 pounds.

1. You have lots of these boxes.

\end{align*}
$$

### Vocabulary

To be **_equal_** means to be the same. In this concept, we are trying to make weights equal. This means we are trying to make each side of the pan balance have the same weight.

### Examples

For each problem below, use the problem solving steps. Your job is to put boxes in the empty pan to make the pans balance. Can you solve the problem in more than one way?

#### Example 1

![0](media/171.png "Figure 5: $$")
\begin{align*}
& \mathbf{Describe:} && \text{There are 2 pans.}\\
&&& \text{One pan holds a box. The box weighs 5 pounds.}\\
&&& \text{The other pan is empty.}\\
&&& \text{Box}\ G \ \text{weighs 1 pounds.}\\
&&& \text{Box}\ H \ \text{weighs 2 pounds.}\\
&&& \text{There are lots of boxes.}\\
& \mathbf{My \ Job:} && \text{Figure out which boxes to put in the pan.}\\
&&& \text{The boxes have to weigh 5 pounds in all.}\\
& \mathbf{Plan:} && \text{Try to make 5 pounds using}\ \text{G} \ \text{boxes only.}\\
&&& \text{Try using}\  H \ \text{boxes only.}\\
&&& \text{Try using both}\  G \ \text{and}\ H \ \text{boxes.}\\
&\mathbf{Solve:} && \text{These will make the pans balance:}\\
&&& 5 \ G \ \text{boxes weigh 5 pounds.}\\
&&& \text{no number of H boxes weigh 5 pounds.}\\
&&& \text{3}\ G \ \text{boxes and}\ 1 \ H \ \text{box weighs 5 pounds.}\\
&&& \text{1}\ G \ \text{box and}\ 2 \ H \ \text{boxes weighs 5 pounds.}\\
& \mathbf{Check:} && 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\\
&&& 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\\

### 3.3 Circles and Arrows 1

<article>

Can you figure out the value of each letter in the diagram below? In this section, we will use problem solving steps to help us find the value of letters in circles and arrows diagrams.

![0](media/210.png "Figure 1: ### Circles and Arrows 1")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what you see in the diagram.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in the problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out the value of the two letters in the diagram.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. There is usually more than one way to solve the problem. You will want to figure out one letter first and then the next letter.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the values you found work for all four of the arrows.

1. Figure out the value of each letter.

### 3.4 Function Machines 1

<article>

Can you use the rule described in the picture below to finish the table? In this section, we will use rules, addition, and subtraction to complete function tables.

![0](media/230.png "Figure 1: ### Function Machines 1")

In order to complete function tables like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the table.
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to complete the table.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the rule to help you to complete the table.
* Fourth, **solve**. In these problems you will solve by completing the table.
* Fifth, **check**. In these problems you will check by counting up or down to make sure that you completed the table correctly.

1. Follow the rule. Complete the table.

### 3.5 Silly Stickers

<article>

We know that one of these stickers costs $5 \cancel{\text{c}}$.

![0](media/252.png "Figure 1: Can you figure out how much it would cost for these stickers? In this section, we will practice skip counting in order to figure out the price of sets of stickers.")

![0](media/253.png "Figure 2: ### Silly Stickers ")

In order to determine the price of a set of stickers like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help us focus.

* First, **describe** what you know.
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the price of the set of stickers.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan will be to count by the cost of one sticker in order to figure out the total cost.
* Fourth, **solve**. Do your plan.
* Fifth, **check**. In these problems, you can check your work by adding together the cost of each sticker.

1. Look at the picture below:

### Vocabulary

**_Skip counting_** is counting by a number other than 1. When you **_count by 2s_** (2, 4, 6, 8) you are skip counting. In this concept we counted by 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, and 10s.

### 3.6 Stars and Moons

<article>

Can you continue the pattern shown below? In this section, we will practice figuring out patterns and then extending them.

![0](media/313.png "Figure 1: ### Stars and Moons ")

In order to continue patterns like the one with stars and moons shown above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see.
* Second, figure out what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to continue the pattern and fill in the empty cards.
* Third, make a **plan**. Decide how you will figure out and then continue the pattern.
* Fourth, **solve**. Fill in the empty cards with the correct number of stars and moons.
* Fifth, **check**. State the pattern you found and verify that it worked for all of the cards.

### Vocabulary

One type of **_pattern_** is when the number of a certain object increases, decreases, or stays the same in a consistent way. In this concept, we saw patterns of stars and moons. With any **_pattern_** you should be able to describe the **_pattern_** and how to get from one step of the **_pattern_** to the next.

## 4.0 CK-12 Algebra Explorations Concepts, Grade 2

<article>

Introduction
------------

In these concepts, you will be introduced to seven key concepts of algebra and will practice your problem solving skills. There are seven concepts, and each one focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. You will focus on describing, identifying your job, planning, solving, and checking your thinking.



</article>

### 4.1 Which Boxes

<article>

You have lots of these boxes. If you wanted to make the pans balance, which boxes will you put in the empty pan? Can you solve this problem in more than one way?

![0](media/333.png "Figure 1: ### Which Boxes")

In order to balance pans like the one above, use the problem solving steps to help you.

* First, **describe** what you see and what information you are given.
* Next, identify what **your job** is and what you are trying to solve. In all of these problems, your job will be to figure out which boxes to put in the pan. You want to make sure that the pans will balance.
* Third, make a **plan** for how you will solve.
* Fourth, **solve** the problem.
* Last, **check** your answer by making sure that the combinations of boxes you found add up to the amount that you needed.

For the problem above, since the left side weighs 10 pounds, you want to make sure the right side will also weigh 10 pounds.

\end{align*}
$$

### Vocabulary

To be **_equal_** means to be the same. In this concept, we are trying to make weights equal. This means we are trying to make each side of the pan balance have the same weight.

### Examples 

For each problem, put boxes in the empty pan to make the pans balance. Can you find more than one answer?

#### Example 1

![0](media/337.png "Figure 5: $J + J + J + J + J + J = 12 \ pounds$")

__$K + K + K + K = 12 \ pounds$__

$J + J + K + L = 12 \ pounds$

#### Example 2

![0](media/338.png "Figure 6: $R + R + R + R + R = 15 \ pounds$")

__$R + R + R + S = 15 \ pounds$__

$Q + S = 15 \ pounds$

### 4.2 What's the Weight

<article>

Look at the picture below. Can you figure out the weight of the blue block? Can you figure out the weight of the red block? In this section, we will learn how to find the weights of individual blocks given information about the weights of multiples or combinations of blocks.

![0](media/346.png "Figure 1: ### What's the Weight ")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the weight of each individual block.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, find the weight of the block using the scale that shows only one type of block first.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Make sure that your solution causes each scale to have the correct weight.

1. Figure out the weight of each block.

### 4.4 Better Buy 2

<article>

Look at the pictures below. Can you figure out which store sells 1 box of noodles for less? In this section, we will learn how to calculate the unit price of items in order to figure out which store has the better buy.

![0](media/378.png "Figure 1: ### Better Buy 2")

In order to figure out which item is the better buy, like in the question above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* Start by **describing** what you see the pictures.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out which item is the better buy.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, you will want to figure out the unit price of the item at each store. Then, figure out which unit price is less.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the unit price at the store you chose is lower.

1. Look at the picture below. Which store sells a gallon of milk for less? How much would it cost to buy 2 gallons of Milk at Mac's?

![0](media/379.png "Figure 2: We can use the problem solving steps to help us with the first question.")

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathbf{Describe:} && \text{Mac's and Zac's sell milk.}\\
&&& \text{Mac's: 1 gallon is \$4}\\
&&& \text{Zac's: 2 gallons are \$10}\\
& \mathbf{My \ Job:} && \text{Figure out the cost of one gallon of milk at Mac's and at Zac's.}\\
&&& \text{Then tell which costs less.}\\
& \mathbf{Plan:} && \text{At Mac's, one gallon is \$4.}\\
&&& \text{At Zac's, 2 gallons are \$10.}\\
&&& \text{To figure out the cost of one gallon, take half of \$10.}\\
&&& \text{Then compare the prices.}\\
& \mathbf{Solve:} && \text{Half of \$10 is \$5. So, one gallon of milk at Zac's is \$5.}\\
&&& \text{One gallon of milk costs less at Mac's than at Zac's.}\\
& \mathbf{Check:} && \text{\$4 is less than \$5}
\end{align*}
$$

The second question was: _how much would it cost to buy 2 gallons of Milk at Mac's?_ Since one gallon of milk at Mac's is $4, two gallons of milk at Mac's is $4+$4=$8.

2. Look at the picture below. Which store sells a bottle of water for less? How much would it cost to buy 3 bottles of water at Mac's?

![0](media/380.png "Figure 3: We can use the problem solving steps to help us with the first question.")

$$

&&& \text{Then tell which costs less.}\\
& \mathbf{Plan:} && \text{At Mac's, one bottle is \$2.}\\
&&& \text{At Zac's, 3 bottles are \$3.}\\
&&& \text{To figure out the cost of one bottle, take one third of \$3.}\\
&&& \text{Then compare the prices.}\\
& \mathbf{Solve:} && \text{One third of \$3 is \$1. So, one bottle of water at Zac's is \$1.}\\
&&& \text{One bottle of water costs less at Zac's than at Mac's.}\\
& \mathbf{Check:} && \text{\$1 is less than \$2}
\end{align*}
$$

The second question was: _how much would it cost to buy 3 bottles of water at Mac's?_ Since one bottle of water at Mac's is $2, three bottles of water at Mac's is $2+$2 + $2=$6.

3. Look at the picture below. Which store sells a pound of onions for less? How much would it cost to buy 2 pounds of onions at Zac's?

![0](media/381.png "Figure 4: We can use the problem solving steps to help us with the first question.")

$$

& \mathbf{Describe:} && \text{Mac's and Zac's sell onions.}\\
&&& \text{Mac's: 2 pounds are 40\cancel{\text{c}}}\\
&&& \text{Zac's: 1 pound is 30\cancel{\text{c}}}\\
& \mathbf{My \ Job:} && \text{Figure out the cost of one pound of onions at Mac's and at Zac's.}\\

&&& \text{Then compare the prices.}\\
& \mathbf{Solve:} && \text{Half of 40\cancel{\text{c}} is 20\cancel{\text{c}}. So, one pound of onions at Mac's is 20\cancel{\text{c}}.}\\
&&& \text{One pound of onions costs less at Mac's than at Zac's.}\\
& \mathbf{Check:} && \text{20\cancel{\text{c}} is less than 30\cancel{\text{c}}}
\end{align*}
$$

The second question was: _how much would it cost to buy 2 pounds of onions at Zac's?_ Since one pound of onions at Zac's is $30\cancel{\text{c}}$, 2 pounds of onions at Zac's is $30\cancel{\text{c}} +30\cancel{\text{c}}=60\cancel{\text{c}}$.

### 4.6 Function Machines 2

<article>

Can you fill in the missing numbers in the table below? In this section, we will learn how to follow two-part rules in order to complete function tables.

![0](media/402.png "Figure 1: ### Function Machines 2 ")

In order to complete function tables like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the table.
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to complete the table.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the rules to help you to complete the table.
* Fourth, **solve**. In these problems you will solve by completing the table.
* Fifth, **check**. In these problems you will check by verifying that the addition and subtraction from the rules leads to the numbers in the out column of the table.

1. Follow the rules. Complete the table.

& \mathbf{Plan:} && \text{Add 4 to each IN number. Then subtract 1 from the sum.}
\end{align*}
$$

**Solve:**

### Vocabulary

A **_function_** is an example of a **_rule_** that states a relationship between two quantities. In this concept, our **_rule_** told us how to go from the in number to the out-number in each table. To **_add_** means to combine or to put together. To **_subtract_** means to take away. In this concept, our rules told us to add and subtract.

### Vocabulary

One type of **_pattern_** is when the number of a certain object increases, decreases, or stays the same in a consistent way. In this concept, we saw patterns of triangles, circles and rectangles. With any pattern you should be able to describe the pattern and how to get from one step of the pattern to the next.

### 5.1 Jars and Jars

<article>

Look at the pictures of the pan balances below. What do you see? Can you figure out the weight of jar z? Can you say anything about the weight of jar x? In this section, we will learn how to use problem solving steps to help us to describe the relative weights of objects given in pan balances.

![0](media/446.png "Figure 1: ### Jars and Jars ")

In order to determine the relationship between the balance pans like the one above, use the problem solving steps to help you.

* First, **describe** what you see and what information you are given.
* Next, identify what **your job** is and what you are trying to solve. In all of these problems, your job will be to figure out the relative weights of the two jars that have letters of them.
* Third, make a **plan** for how you will solve. See if you can figure out the exact weight of one jar first. Then, describe what you know about the weight of the other jar.
* Fourth, **solve** the problem.
* Last, **check** your answer.

### Vocabulary

To be **_equal_** means to be the same. When pans are **_balanced_** then the weights of the two pans are **_equal_**. To be **_greater than_** means to be bigger. To be **_less than_** means to be smaller. When two pans are not **_balanced_** then the weight of one pan is **_greater than_** the weight of the other pan.

### 5.2 Circles and Arrows 3

<article>

Look at the picture below. The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Can you figure out the value of each letter? In this section, we will practice solving for unknowns in circles and arrows diagrams.

![0](media/459.png "Figure 1: ### Circles and Arrows 3 ")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what you see in the diagram.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out the value of the two letters in the diagram.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. There is usually more than one way to solve the problem. You will want to figure out one letter first and then the next letter.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the values you found work for all 6 of the arrows.

1. The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Figure out the value of each letter.

### 5.3 Follow the Rule 3

<article>

Look at the table below. $s$ stands for a number. Can you follow the rule and complete the table? In this section, we will practice using rules to complete tables.

![0](media/472.png "Figure 1: ### Follow the Rule 3")

In order to complete function tables like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the table.
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to complete the table.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the rules to help you to complete the table.
* Fourth, **solve**. In these problems you will solve by completing the table.
* Fifth, **check**. In these problems you will check by making sure that the numbers in the table work with the rule.

### 5.4 What's My Rule

<article>

Look at the table below. $p$ and $t$ stand for numbers. Can you write a rule to represent the relationship between $p$ and $t$? Can you complete the table? In this section we will learn how to write rules to represent what we see in tables.

![0](media/490.png "Figure 1: ### What's My Rule ")

In order to write rules for function tables like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the table.
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to write the rule for the table.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to look for a pattern to help you figure out the rule.
* Fourth, **solve**. In these problems, you will state the rule in an equation or in words and then complete the table.
* Fifth, **check**. In these problems you will check by making sure that the numbers in the table work with the rule.

1. Write the rule represented by the table. Then, complete the table.

### 5.5 Weight Problems

<article>

Look at the picture below. Can you figure out the weight of the green block? What about the yellow block? In this section, we will learn how to find the weights of individual blocks given information about the weights of multiples or combinations of blocks.

![0](media/505.png "Figure 1: ### Weight Problems ")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the weight of each individual block.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, find the weight of the block using the scale that shows only one type of block first.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Make sure that your solution causes each scale to have the correct weight.

1. Figure out the weight of each block.

### 5.6 Write Equations

<article>

Look at the pictures of the scales below. Can you write equations to represent what you see on each scale? Can you figure out the weight of the green block? Can you figure out the weight of the blue block? In this section, we will learn how to work with equations that represent what we see on scales.

![0](media/518.png "Figure 1: ### Write Equations ")

In order to solve the problem above, we can write equations to represent what we see on each scale. We know that if we add the weights of each of the blocks on one scale together, the total weight must be the same as the number on the scale.

If we look at the scale on the left, we see that there are two green blocks that weigh 8 pounds total. An equation would be:

![0](media/519.png "Figure 2: There is another way to think about the equation.")

![0](media/520.png "Figure 3: This means, I could also write the equation as:")

![0](media/521.png "Figure 4: In the following examples, we will practice writing equations in different ways and matching equations with scales.")

1. Fill in the number to finish the equation:

![0](media/522.png "Figure 5: On the left side of the equation we see three 3 blocks. This means, we need a 3 on the right side of the equation next to the red block. The equation should look like this:")

![0](media/523.png "Figure 6: 2. Circle the equation that matches the scale:")

![0](media/524.png "Figure 7: On the scale we see two red blocks and one yellow block. They add up to 20 pounds. The correct equation should have 2 red blocks and one yellow block. The correct equation is **c**.")

3. Eric wrote these equations from pictures of scales. Use Eric’s equations. Find the weight of each block.

![0](media/525.png "Figure 8: From the first equation we can see that 2 blue blocks weigh 6 pounds. This means that each blue block is 3 pounds.")

From the second equation we can see that one yellow block and one blue block together weigh eight pounds. Since we know that the blue block is 3 pounds, we have this equation: $\text{yellow block } + 3 = 8$

Because $5+3=8$, we know that the yellow block must be 5 pounds. Here is our final answer:

![0](media/526.png "Figure 9: #### Earlier Problem Revisited")

![0](media/527.png "Figure 10: We can use problem solving steps to help:")

![0](media/528.png "Figure 11: ### Vocabulary")

In math, an **_unknown_** is a letter that stands for a number that we do not yet know the value of. In this concept, the blocks that we did not know the weights of were **_unknowns_**. An **_equation_** is a math sentence that tells us two quantities that are equal. In this concept, we wrote **_equations_** with unknowns to represent what we saw on the scales.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Write equations for each scale. Figure out the weight of each block.

### 5.7 Better Buy 3

<article>

Look at the signs below for the price of yo-yos at two different stores. Which store has the better buy for one yo-yo? In this section, we will practice finding the unit price of items in order to determine which store has the better buy.

![0](media/552.png "Figure 1: ### Better Buy 3 ")

In order to figure out which item is the better buy, like in the question above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* Start by **describing** what you see the pictures.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out which item is the better buy.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, you will want to figure out the unit price of the item at each store. Then, figure out which unit price is less.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the unit price at the store you chose is lower.

![0](media/573.png "Figure 2: We can use problem solving steps to help.")

**Describe:** I see a graph. There are four students. There are pictures of pencils after each student's name. The key shows that each pencil picture stands for 6 pencils.

**My Job:** Figure out the difference in the number of pencils for Sam and Wendy.

**Plan:** Use the key. Figure out the number of pencils for Sam and Wendy. Then subtract to find the difference.

**Solve:** Sam has 4 fewer pencil pictures than Wendy. Each pencil picture stands for 6 pencils. $4 \times 6 = 24$. Sam has 24 fewer pencils than Wendy.

**Check:** Sam: $6+6+6=18$ pencils.

__Wendy: $6+6+6+6+6+6+6=42$ pencils.__

42-18=24

2. Look at the pictograph below and answer the question.

**Describe:** I see a graph. There are four students. There are pictures of board games after each student's name. The key shows that each board game picture stands for 3 board games.

**My Job:** Figure out the difference in the number of board games for Kyle and Jan.

**Plan:** Use the key. Figure out the number of board games for Kyle and Jan. Then subtract to find the difference.

**Solve:** Kyle has 3 more board game pictures than Jan. Each board game picture stands for 3 board games. $3 \times 3 = 9$. Kyle has 9 more board games than Jan.

**Check:** Jan: $3+3=6$ board games.

__Kyle: $3+3+3+3+3=15$ board games.__

15-6=9

A **pictograph** is a way of representing information where pictures stand for a certain number of items. In this concept, we saw pictographs that gave us information on the relative number of certain objects that different students had.

### Examples 

Look at the pictographs below and answer the questions.

#### Example 1

![0](media/579.png "Figure 8: 36; There are 4 more symbols after Ralph's name than after Vince's name, so Ralph has $4 \times 9$, or 36 more markers than Vince. ")

#### Example 2

![0](media/580.png "Figure 9: 20; There are 4 more symbols after Olya's name than after Nat's name. Each symbol stands for 5 puzzles, so Olya has $4 \times 5$, or 20 more puzzles than Nat.")

#### Example 3

![0](media/581.png "Figure 10: 2; There are 3 fewer symbols after Gary’s name than after Ellen’s name. The FACT tells us that Gary has 6 fewer stuffed animals than Ellen. So 3 symbols equal 6 animals. Each symbol stands for $6 \div 3$, or 2 stuffed animals.")

## 6.0 CK-12 Algebra Explorations Concepts, Grade 4

<article>

Introduction
------------

In these concepts, you will continue to develop eight key concepts of algebra and will practice your problem solving skills. There are eight concepts, and each one focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. You will focus on describing, identifying your job, planning, solving, and checking your thinking.

### 6.1 Boxes and Boxes

<article>

Look at the pictures of the pan balances below. What do you see? If all boxes have whole number weights, can you figure out the weight of box m? Can you say anything about the weight of box r? In this section, we will learn how to use problem solving steps to help us to describe the relative weights of objects given in pan balances.

![0](media/591.png "Figure 1: ### Boxes and Boxes ")

In order to determine the relationship between the balance pans like the one above, use the problem solving steps to help you.

* First, **describe** what you see and what information you are given.
* Next, identify what **your job** is and what you are trying to solve. In all of these problems, your job will be to figure out the relative weights of the two boxes that have letters on them.
* Third, make a **plan** for how you will solve. Figure out what information each pan balance gives you.
* Fourth, **solve** the problem.
* Last, **check** your answer.

#### Determining Unknown Weights 

1. What could be the weights? Tell how you figured it out. All weights are whole numbers of pounds.

### Vocabulary

To be **_equal_** means to be the same. When pans are **_balanced_** then the weights of the two pans are **_equal_**. To be **greater than** means to be bigger. To be **_less than_** means to be smaller. When two pans are not **_balanced_** then the weight of one pan is **_greater than_** the weight of the other pan.

### Examples

For each problem, what could be the weights of the two lettered boxes? Tell how you figured it out. All weights are whole numbers of pounds.

#### Example 1

![0](media/596.png "Figure 6: From J, $2v=12$, so $v=6$ pounds. From K, since $v$ is heavier than $3u,$ $3u<6,$ and $u<2.$ So, $u=1$ pound. ")

#### Example 2

![0](media/597.png "Figure 7: From L, $3x<9$ and $x<3$. So $x=1$ or $2$ pounds. From M, $w=2x.$ Since $x=1$ or $2,$ $w=2$ or $4$ pounds. ")

#### Example 3

![0](media/598.png "Figure 8: From N, $3y=15,$ so $y=5$ pounds. From P, $y>2z,$ so $6>2z.$ Then $z=1$ or $2$ pounds.")

### 6.2 Circles and Arrows 4

<article>

Look at the picture below. The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Can you figure out the value of each of the three letters? In this section, we will practice solving for unknowns in circles and arrows diagrams.

![0](media/604.png "Figure 1: ### Circles and Arrows 4 ")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what you see in the diagram.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out the value of the three letters in the diagram.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. There is usually more than one way to solve the problem. You will want to figure out one letter first and then the next letter.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the values you found work for all six of the arrows.

#### Finding Unknown Values

### 6.3 Follow the Rule 4

<article>

Look at the table below. $a$ and $b$ stand for numbers. Can you follow the rule to complete the table? In this section, we will practice using one or two step rules to complete function tables.

![0](media/617.png "Figure 1: ### Follow the Rule 4")

In order to complete function tables like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the table.
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to complete the table.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the rules to help you to complete the table.
* Fourth, **solve**. In these problems you will solve by completing the table.
* Fifth, **check**. In these problems you will check by making sure that the numbers in the table work with the rule.

### 6.4 Weighing Weights

<article>

![0](media/650.png "Figure 1: ### Weighing Weights")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the weight of each individual block.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, find the weight of the block using the scale that shows only one type of unknown block first.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Make sure that your solution causes each scale to have the correct weight.

#### Finding Unknown Weights 

1. Figure out the weights of the blocks.

![0](media/651.png "Figure 2: We can use the problem solving steps to help.")

**Describe:** There are three scales, D, E, and F, with blocks. Scale D has a blue block and a 6 pound weight. Scale E has 3 red blocks. Scale F has one red block, one blue block, and one yellow block.

**My Job:** Figure out the weights of the blocks.

**Plan:** Start with D and find the weight of the blue block. Write the weight of the blue block on the pictures. Next, find the weight of the red block and write the weight of the red block on the pictures. Finally, find the weight of the yellow block.

**Solve:** Scale D tells us that $\text{blue block} + 6 = 9$, so the blue block is 3 pounds. Scale E tells us that 3 red blocks weigh 15 pounds, so each red block weighs 5 pounds. Finally, Scale F tells us that one red block, one blue block, and one yellow block together weigh 10 pounds. This means $3+5+ \text{yellow block }=10$ so the yellow block weighs 2 pounds.

**Check:** Replace each block with its weight. Scale D: 6+3=9. Scale E: 5+5+5=15. Scale F: 3+5+2=10.

2. Figure out the weights of the blocks.

![0](media/652.png "Figure 3: We can use the problem solving steps to help.")

**Describe:** There are three scales, G, H, and I, with blocks. Scale G has a yellow block and an 8 pound weight. Scale H has a red block and a yellow block. Scale I has 2 red blocks and one blue block.

**My Job:** Figure out the weights of the blocks.

**Plan:** Start with G and find the weight of the yellow block. Write the weight of the yellow block on the pictures. Next, find the weight of the red block using scale H and write the weight of the red block on the pictures. Finally, find the weight of the blue block using scale I.

**Solve:** Scale G tells us that $\text{yellow block} + 8 = 15$, so the yellow block is 7 pounds. Scale H tells us that one yellow block and one red block weigh 10 pounds, so the red block must weigh 3 pounds. Finally, Scale I tells us that 2 red blocks and one blue block weigh 10 pounds. This means $3+3+ \text{blue block }=10$ so the blue block weighs 4 pounds.

**Check:** Replace each block with its weight. Scale G: 8+7=15. Scale H: 7+3=10. Scale I: 3+4+3=10.

3. Figure out the weights of the blocks.

![0](media/653.png "Figure 4: We can use the problem solving steps to help.")

**Describe:** There are three scales, J, K, and L, with blocks. Scale J has a red block and a 10 pound block. Scale K has 2 red blocks and a blue block. Scale L has one red block, one blue block, and one yellow block.

**My Job:** Figure out the weights of the blocks.

**Plan:** Start with Scale J and find the weight of a red block. Write the weight of the red block on the pictures. Next, find the weight of the blue block using Scale K and write the weight of the blue block on the pictures. Finally, find the weight of the yellow block using Scale L.

**Solve:** Scale J tells us that $\text{red block} + 10 = 15$, so the red block is 5 pounds. Scale K tells us that 2 red blocks and one blue block weigh 16 pounds, so $5+5+ \text{blue block}=16$ and the blue block must weigh 6 pounds. Finally, Scale L tells us that one red block, one blue block, and one yellow block together weigh 15 pounds. This means $6+5+ \text{yellow block }=15$ so the yellow block weighs 4 pounds.

**Check:** Replace each block with its weight. Scale J: 10+5=15. Scale K: 6+5+5=16. Scale L: 6+5+4=15.

### 6.5 Equations with Letters

<article>

Look at the pictures of the scales below. Can you write equations to represent what you see on each scale? Can you figure out the value of each letter? In this section, we will learn how to work with equations that represent what we see on scales. We will then learn how to solve sets of equations without scales.

![0](media/665.png "Figure 1: ### Equations with Letters ")

In order to solve the problem above, we can write equations to represent what we see on each scale. We know that if we add the weights of each of the blocks on one scale together, the total weight must be the same as the number on the scale.

In order to figure out the values of the letters, go one letter at a time. First, figure out the value of x. Then, use that information to help find the value of y. Finally, once we know x and y figure out the value of z.

#### Writing Equations 

1. Write equations. Figure out the weights of the blocks.

### Vocabulary

In math, an **_unknown_** is a letter that stands for a number that we do not yet know the value of. In this concept, the blocks that we did not know the weights of were **_unknowns_**. An **_equation_** is a math sentence that tells us two quantities that are equal. In this concept, we wrote **_equations_** with unknowns to represent what we saw on the scales. A **_system of equations_** is a set of equations that represents a given problem. Since we wrote multiple equations for each problem in this concept, we wrote a **_system of equations_** for each problem.

### 6.6 Bargain Shopping

<article>

Look at the signs below for the price of pastels at two different stores. Which store has the better buy for 3 boxes of pastels? In this section, we will practice comparing the prices of items in order to determine which store has the better buy.

![0](media/675.png "Figure 1: ### Bargain Shopping")

In order to figure out which item is the better buy, like in the question above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* Start by **describing** what you see the pictures.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out which item is the better buy.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, you will want to figure out the unit price of the item at one of the stores. Then, compare the price for the number of items in the problem.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the price at the store you chose is lower.

### 6.7 Map Quest 4

<article>

Look at the map and list of facts below. Can you figure out the distances in miles between the cities? Can you name the cities using the facts? In this section we will learn how to read and work with maps.

![0](media/689.png "Figure 1: **Facts:**")

1.  Woodstock to Toledo is 40 miles.
2.  Mesa to Kent is 80 miles.
3.  Rocky Creek to Mesa round trip is 40 miles.
4.  Mesa to Toledo is the same distance as Woodstock to Kent.

### Map Quest 4 

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out where each city is on the map.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, measure distances with a ruler and use the facts to figure out which city is which.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Verify that the measured distances between the cities work with the facts.

#### Finding Distances

### 6.8 Bar Graphs

<article>

Look at the bar graph and the list of FACTS below. Can you label the bar graph correctly by writing the grade levels on the lines under the bars? In this section, we will learn how to use bar graphs to correctly display information.

![0](media/701.png "Figure 1: **FACTS**")

1.  There are twice as many grade 1 students as grade 4 students.
2.  There are 10 more grade 1 students than grade 3 students.
3.  There are half as many grade 5 students as grade 3 students.
4.  The total number of student in the 5 grades is 175.

### Bar Graphs 

In order to interpret and use bar graphs like the one above, use the problem solving steps to help you.

* First, **describe** what you see and what information you are given.
* Next, identify what **your job** is and what you are trying to solve. In these problems, your job will be to label the bar graph correctly, or correctly fill in missing bars.
* Third, make a **plan** for how you will solve.
* Fourth, **solve** the problem.
* Last, **check** your answer. Make sure your solution works with all of the facts.

#### Interpreting Bar Graphs 

1. Use the FACTS and the bar graph to figure out the names. Write the names on the lines under the bars.

![0](media/702.png "Figure 2: **FACTS**")

2.  Cal read twice as many books as Abe.
3.  Bea didn’t read the greatest number of books.
4.  Together, Bea and Cal read 21 books.

We can use problem solving steps to help.

**Describe:** The graph has 5 bars. The bars show numbers of books. The FACTS give information about the number of books each student has read.

**My Job:** Use the facts to figure out the student represented by each bar. Write the names under the bars.

**Plan:** Use the scale. Figure out the number of books for each bar. Find numbers that fit the FACTS. Label the bars with the students.

**Solve:** From left to right, the bars stand for 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12 books.

![0](media/703.png "Figure 3: **Check:** Ella read half as many books as Dora. 4 is half of 8. Cal read twice as many books as Abe. 12 is twice 6. Bea didn't read the greatest number of books. 9 is less than 12. Bea and Cal read 21 books. 9+12=21.")

2. Use the FACTS and the bar graph to figure out the names. Write the names on the lines under the bars.

![0](media/704.png "Figure 4: **FACTS**")

1.  Jack has half as many markers as Neil.
2.  Together, Jack and Mimi have the same number of markers as Leanne.
3.  Leanne has twice as many markers as Kent

We can use problem solving steps to help.

**Describe:** The graphs has 5 bars. The bars show numbers of markers. The FACTS give information about the number of markers that each student has.

**My Job:** Use the facts to figure out the student represented by each bar. Write the students under the bars.

**Plan:** Use the scale. Figure out the number of markers for each bar. Find numbers that fit the FACTS. Label the bars with the students.

**Solve:** From left to right, the bars stand for 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 markers.

![0](media/705.png "Figure 5: **Check:** Jack has 15 markers which is half as many markers as Neil who has 30 markers. Together, Jack (15 markers) and Mimi (25 markers) have the same number of markers as Leanne (40 markers). Leanne, who has 40 markers, has twice as many markers as Kent, who has 20 markers.")

3. Use the FACTS and the bar graph. Draw the missing bars.

![0](media/706.png "Figure 6: **FACTS:**")

1.  Lily has twice as many markers as Jan.
2.  Bob has 10 fewer markers than Kyle.
3.  Eric has half as many markers as Lily.

We can use problem solving steps to help.

**Describe:** The bar graph shows numbers of markers. Three bars are missing. FACTS give information about the missing bars.

**My Job:** Use the FACTS. Draw the missing bars.

**Plan:** Figure out the number of markers for Jan and Kyle. Then use the FACTS.

__1. Lily’s bar: Multiply Jan’s number of markers by 2. Draw Lily’s bar.__

3. Eric’s bar: Divide Lily’s number of markers by 2. Draw Eric’s bar.

**Solve:**

![0](media/707.png "Figure 7: **Check:** Lily has $2 \times 30$, or 60 markers. Bob has $45 - 10$, or 35 markers. Eric has $60 \div 2$, or 30 markers.")

## 7.0 CK-12 Algebra Explorations Concepts, Grade 5

<article>

Introduction
------------

In these concepts, you will continue to develop ten key concepts of algebra and will practice your problem solving skills. There are ten concepts, and each one focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. You will focus on describing, identifying your job, planning, solving, and checking your thinking.

### 7.1 Solve for the Unknown

<article>

Can you use the order of operations? What's the value of $a$? In this section, we will learn to use the order of operations.

$(3 + 5) \div 2 + 4 \times 6 = a$

### Solve for the Unknown 

The **order of operations** tells us the correct order of evaluating math expressions. We always do **_parenthesis first_**. Then we do **_multiplication and division (from left to right)_** and finally **_addition and subtraction (from left to right)_**.

In order to evaluate expressions using the order of operations, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the problem. What operations are there?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to solve for the unknown.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the order of operations.
* Fourth, **solve**.
* Fifth, **check**.

#### Solving for Unknown Values

### 7.2 Distributive Property and Solving for Unknowns

<article>

Can you figure out the value of b in the equation below? Do you know how to use the distributive property and the order of operations? In this section, you will learn how to correctly use the distributive property and order of operations to solve for unknowns.

$3 \times (6 + b) = 30$

### The Distributive Property and Solving for Unknowns 

The **order of operations** tells us the correct order of evaluating math expressions. We always do **_parentheses first_**. Then we do **_multiplication and division (from left to right)_** and finally **_addition and subtraction (from left to right)_**. The **_distributive property_** allows us to remove parentheses when there is an unknown inside of them.

In order to evaluate expressions using the distributive property and the order of operations, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the problem. What operations are there?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to solve for the unknown.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the distributive property and the order of operations.
* Fourth, **solve**.
* Fifth, **check**. Substitute your answer into the equation and make sure it works.

\end{align*}
$$

Next solve the equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
5a+20&=40 \\ 5a&=20. a&=4
\end{align*}
$$

**Check:**

$$
\begin{align*}
5 \times (4 + 4) &= 40. 5 \times 8 &= 40. 40&=40
\end{align*}

### 7.3 Circle Sums 5

<article>

Look at the picture below. The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Can you figure out the value of each of the three letters? In this section, we will practice solving for unknowns in circles and arrows diagrams.

![0](media/720.png "Figure 1: ### Circle Sums 5")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what you see in the diagram.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out the value of the three letters in the diagram.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. There is usually more than one way to solve the problem. You will want to figure out one letter first and then the next letter. In some of these problems you might need to find the sum of two letters first in order to find the value of one letter.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the values you found work for all six of the arrows.

### 7.4 Hanging Scales 5

<article>

Look at the pictures of the scales below. Can you write equations to represent what you see on each scale? Can you figure out the value of each letter? In this section, we will practice working with equations that represent what we see on scales. We will then practice solving these systems of equations.

![0](media/733.png "Figure 1: ### Hanging Scales 5")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the value of each of the three variables.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, write equations to represent the scales first. Then, solve the system of equations.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Make sure that your solution causes each scale to have the correct weight.

### Vocabulary

In math, an **_unknown_** is a letter that stands for a number that we do not yet know the value of. In this concept, the blocks that we did not know the weights of were **_unknowns_**. An **_equation_** is a math sentence that tells us two quantities that are equal. In this concept, we wrote **_equations_** with unknowns to represent what we saw on the scales. A **_system of equations_** is a set of equations that represents a given problem. Since we wrote multiple equations for each problem in this concept, we wrote a **_system of equations_** for each problem.

### Examples 

Write equations. Figure out the weights of the blocks.

#### Example 2

### 7.6 Rectangle Facts 5

<article>

Look at the facts below about Rectangle A. Can you figure out the length of Rectangle A? What about the width? What about the area? In this section, we will learn how to use information about the length, width and perimeter of a rectangle to figure out the dimension and area of a rectangle.

![0](media/747.png "Figure 1: ### Rectangle Facts A ")

In order to solve the problem about the rectangle above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the dimensions and area of the rectangle.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, draw a rectangle and label the sides with the information about length and width. Then write and solve an equation using the perimeter in order to figure out the dimensions of the rectangle. Once you have the dimensions, you can figure out the area of the rectangle by multiplying the dimensions.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Verify that your solution works with the facts about the rectangle.

#### Finding the Length, Width, and Area 

1. Find the length, width, and area of the rectangle described below.

![0](media/748.png "Figure 2: We can use problem solving steps to help.")

**Describe:** The length is 8 inches greater than its width. Its perimeter is 24 inches.

**My Job:** Use the facts about the rectangle. Figure out its length and width in inches. Then find the area of the rectangle.

**Plan:** Draw a rectangle and label the width as $w$ and the length as $w+8$ because the length is 8 inches greater than the width. Then, use the facts to figure out the values for the length and width. Finally, figure out the area.

**Solve:** Here is a picture of the rectangle:

![0](media/749.png)

\[Figure 3\]__The perimeter is 24 inches so $w+w+8+w+w+8=24$. This means $4w+16=24$ so $4w=8$ and $w=2$.__

The area is $2\times 10 = 20$ square inches.

**Check:** $P:2+10+2+10=24$. $A: 2\times 10 =20$.

2. Find the length, width, and area of the rectangle described below.

![0](media/750.png "Figure 4: We can use problem solving steps to help.")

**Describe:** The width of the rectangle is 3 inches less than its length. Its perimeter is 26 inches.

**My Job:** Use the facts about the rectangle. Figure out its length and width in inches. Then find the area of the rectangle.

**Plan:** Draw a rectangle and label the length as $l$ and the width as $l-3$ because the width is 3 less than the length. Then, use the facts to figure out the values for the length and width. Finally, figure out the area.

**Solve:** Here is a picture of the rectangle:

![0](media/751.png)

\[Figure 5\]__The perimeter is 28 inches so $l+l-3+l+l-3=26$. This means $4l-6=26$ so $4l=32$ and $l=8$.__

The area is $8\times 5 = 40$ square inches.

**Check:** $P:8+5+8+5=26$. $A: 8\times 5 =40$.

3. Find the length, width, and area of the rectangle described below.

**Plan:** Draw a rectangle and label the length as $l$ and the width as $l-4$ because the width is 4 less than the length. Then, use the facts to figure out the values for the length and width. Finally, figure out the area.

**Solve:** Here is a picture of the rectangle:

![0](media/753.png)

\[Figure 7\]__The perimeter is 28 inches so $l+l-4+l+l-4=28$. This means $4l-8=28$ so $4l=36$ and $l=9$.__

The area is $9\times 5 = 45$ square inches.

**Check:** $P:9+5+9+5=28$. $A: 9\times 5 =45$.

### Vocabulary

One type of **_pattern_** is when the number of a certain object increases, decreases, or stays the same in a consistent way. In this concept, we saw patterns of circles and squares where the numbers of circles and squares were increasing. With any pattern you should be able to describe the pattern and how to get from one step of the pattern to the next. A **_rule_** is an equation that can describe a pattern. In this concept, we wrote **_rules_** for patterns that related the figure number to the number of shapes.

### Examples 

For each problem, look at the figures below and answer the questions.

#### Example 1

![0](media/774.png "Figure 10: 13 trapezoids in Figure 10.")

Rule: Number of Trapezoids is 3 more than the Figure Number.

![0](media/775.png "Figure 11: #### Example 2")

![0](media/776.png "Figure 12: 20 circles in Figure 10.")

Rule: Number of Circles is the Figure Number plus the Figure Number, or 2 times the Figure Number.

![0](media/777.png)

\[Figure 13\] 

#### Example 3

![0](media/778.png "Figure 14: 30 purple tiles in Figure 10.")

Rule: Number of Purple Tiles is 3 times the Figure Number.

### 7.8 Smart Shopping

<article>

Look at the pictures below. Can you compare the prices of calendars between the stores? Which store has the better buy for calendars? In this section, we will learn how to compare prices between stores when we can not easily determine the unit prices for items.

![0](media/791.png "Figure 1: ### Smart Shopping ")

In order to figure out which item is the better buy, like in the question above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* Start by **describing** what you see the pictures.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out which item is the better buy.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, you will want to figure out the least common multiple of the 2 quantities of items. Then, find the total price for that number of items for each store. Figure out which store is the better buy.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the price at the store you chose is lower.

### Vocabulary

The **_least common multiple_** of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. For example, the multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24... The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24,... Both 12 and 24 are common multiples of 4 and 6; however, 12 is the **least** common multiple because it is the smallest multiple that they have in common.

### 7.9 Save More

<article>

Look at the signs for the toothpaste below. How much would it cost to buy 2 tubes of toothpaste at each store? What if you use the coupon? Which store has the better buy? How much less is the cost at that store? In this section, we will learn how to compare prices at stores when we have a coupon to use.

![0](media/805.png "Figure 1: ### Save More ")

In order to figure out which item is the better buy, like in the question above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* Start by **describing** what you see the pictures.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out which item is the better buy and by how much.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, you will want to figure out the original cost for the number of items you want to buy at each store. Then, calculate how much you will pay after using the coupon. Finally, figure out which store has the better buy and by how much.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that all your calculations are correct.

#### Finding the Better Buy

1. Buy 1 comb. Use the coupon. Which store has the better buy? How much less is the cost at that store?

![0](media/806.png "Figure 2: We can use problem solving steps to help.")

| Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Describe: | Two store signs show the cost for combs. The coupon gives 10% off the price. |
| My Job: | Figure out the store that has the better buy for 1 comb after using the coupon. Then figure out the difference in cost. |
| Solve: | ABC's: 5 combs are $15 so each comb is $3. Gem's: 6 combs are $12 so each comb is $2. Using the coupon at ABC's, 10% off means the cost after the coupon is 90% of $3.00, or 0.9 × 3 = $2.70. Using the coupon at Gem's, 10% off means the price after the coupon is 90% of $2.00 or 0.9 × 2 = $1.80. $2.70 − $1.80 = $0.90 The cost is $0.90 less at Gem's. |
| Check: | At ABC's 1 comb is $3.00 and 10% off of $3.00 is $0.30. The cost after using the coupon is ($3.00 - $0.30), or $2.70. At Gem's 1 comb is $2.00 and 10% off of $2.00 is $0.20. The cost after using the coupon is ($2.00 - $0.20), or $1.80. $2.70 − $1.80 = $0.90. |

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

![0](media/809.png "Figure 5: We can use problem solving steps to help.")

### Vocabulary

A **_discount_** is a savings on an item because of a sale or a coupon. In this concept, we used coupons that had discounts in the form of **_percents_** of. **_Percent_** means parts per 100. The symbol for **_percent_** is %. For example, 30% means 30 out of every 100. So, 30% of 100 would be 30. 30% of 50 would be 15. When working with percents, it is often helpful to convert them to decimals when doing calculations, as we did in this concept.

### Examples 

#### Example 1

Buy 2 toothbrushes. Use the coupon. Which store has the better buy? How much less is the cost at that store?

![0](media/810.png "Figure 6: Gems; $0.25 or less.")

ABC's: 1 toothbrush is $\$5.25 \div 3$ or $1.75, so 2 toothbrushes are $3.50. With the coupon they are $0.5 \times \$3.50$, or $1.75.

Gems: 2 toothbrushes is half of $6.00, or $3.00. With the coupon they are $0.5 \times \$3.00$, or $1.50

#### Example 2

Buy 4 bars of soap. Use the coupon. Which store has the better buy? How much less is the cost at that store?

![0](media/811.png "Figure 7: ABC's: $0.28 or less. ")

ABC's: 4 bars of soap are $\frac {1}{2}$ of $7.20, or $3.60. With the coupon, they are $0.7 \times \$3.60$, or $2.52.

Gem's: 10 bars for $10 is $1 for one bar and $4 for 4 bars. With the coupon they are $0.7 \times \$4.00$ or $2.80

#### Example 3

Buy 4 bottles of shampoo. Use the coupon. Which store has the better buy? How much less is the cost at that store?

![0](media/812.png "Figure 8: Gem's: $0.24 less.")

ABC's: One bottle is $\$12.50 \div 5$ or $2.50, so 4 bottles is $4 \times \$2.50$ or $10. With the coupon, the bottles are $0.6 \times \$10$ or $6.00

Gem's: One bottle is $\$14.40 \div 6$ or $2.40, so 4 bottles is $4 \times \$2.40$ or $9.60. With the coupon, the bottles are $0.6 \times \$9.60$ or $5.76

$6.00=$5.76=$0.24

## 8.0 CK-12 Algebra Explorations Concepts, Grade 6

<article>

Introduction
------------

In these concepts, you will continue to develop ten key concepts of algebra and will practice your problem solving skills. There are ten concepts, and each one focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. You will focus on describing, identifying your job, planning, solving, and checking your thinking.



</article>

### 8.1 What's the Value

<article>

Look at the equation below. Can you figure out the value of $z$? In this section, we will learn how to use the order of operations to help us to solve equations.

$$
6 \times 3^2 \div 2 + z + 4(7 - 3) + 2^3 \div 4 = 3^2 \times 6 + 1
$$

### What's the Value 

The **order of operations** tells us the correct order of evaluating math expressions. We always do **_parentheses first_** and then **_exponents_**. Next we do **_multiplication and division (from left to right)_** and finally **_addition and subtraction (from left to right)_**.

In order to evaluate expressions using the order of operations, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the problem. What operations are there?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to solve for the unknown.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the order of operations.
* Fourth, **solve**.
* Fifth, **check**. Substitute your answer into the equation and make sure it works.

#### Finding Unknown Values 

1. Follow the order of operations and show each step. What is the value of the variable?

$b + 2 \times 3 \times 2^2 \div 3 = 2(5 + 6) - 2$

We can use the problem solving steps to help us with the order of operations.

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathbf{Describe:} && \text{The equation has parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction and addition.}\\
&&& b \ \text{is the variable.}\\
\\
& \mathbf{My \ Job:} && \text{Apply the order of operations rule to figure out the value of}\ b.\\
\\
& \mathbf{Solve:} && b + 2 \times 3 \times 2^2 \div 3 = 2(5 + 6) - 2\\

### Vocabulary

The **_order of operations_** tells us the correct order of evaluating math expressions. We always do **_parentheses first_** and then **_exponents_**. Next we do **_multiplication and division (from left to right)_** and finally **_addition and subtraction (from left to right)_**.

### Examples

For each problem, follow the order of operations and show each step. What is the value of the variable?

#### Example 1

$2 + 5^2 \div 5 \times 1 + 0 \times 34 = 2y - 7(4 - 3)$

$$
\begin{align*}
2 + 5^2 \div 5 \times 1 + 0 \times 34 &= 2y - 7(4 - 3)\\
2 + 5^2 \div 5 \times 1 + 0 \times 34 &= 2y - 7 \times 1\\
2 + 25 \div 5 \times 1 + 0 \times 34 &= 2y - 7 \times 1\\
2 + 5 + 0 &= 2y - 7\\
7 &= 2y - 7\\
7 + 7 &= 2y\\
14 &= 2y\\
7 &= y
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 2

\begin{align*}
2a + 5(9 - 8) \times 2^2 &= 2^2 \times 3^2 + 2\\
2a + 5 \times 1 \times 2^2 &= 2^2 \times 3^2 + 2\\
2a + 5 \times 1 \times 4 &= 4 \times 9 + 2\\
2a + 20 &= 36 + 2\\
2a + 20 &= 38\\
2a &= 38 - 20\\
2a &= 18\\
a &= 9
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 3

$$
\begin{align*}
9^2 - 8^2 - 16 + 4^3 + 2^2 &= e(5 + 2) - 1\\
9^2 - 8^2 - 16 + 4^3 + 2^2 &= e \times 7 - 1\\

### 8.2 Solve for Unknowns

<article>

Look at the equation below. Can you figure out the value of $a$? In this section, we will practice using the order of operations and the distributive property to solve equations.

$$
4 \times 1 + 6(a - 1) - 9 - 2^3 = 2 + 3^2
$$

### Solve for Unknowns 

The **order of operations** tells us the correct order of evaluating math expressions. We always do **_parentheses first_**. Then we do **_exponents_**. Next we do **_multiplication and division (from left to right)_** and finally **_addition and subtraction (from left to right)_**. The **_distributive property $(a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c)$_** allows us to remove parentheses when there is an unknown inside of them.

In order to evaluate expressions using the distributive property and the order of operations, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the problem. What operations are there?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to solve for the unknown.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the distributive property and the order of operations.
* Fourth, **solve**.
* Fifth, **check**. Substitute your answer into the equation and make sure it works.

### 8.3 Circle Sums 6

<article>

Look at the picture below. The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Can you figure out the value of each of the four letters? In this section, we will practice solving for unknowns in circles and arrows diagrams.

![0](media/830.png "Figure 1: ### Circle Sums 6")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what you see in the diagram.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out the value of the four letters in the diagram.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. There is usually more than one way to solve the problem. In some of these problems you might need to find the sum of three letters first in order to find the value of one letter.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the values you found work for all seven of the arrows.

### 8.4 Hanging Scales 6

<article>

Look at the pictures of the scales below. Can you write equations to represent what you see on each scale? Can you figure out the value of each letter? In this sections, we will practice working with equations that represent what we see on scales. We will then practice solving these systems of equations.

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the value of each of the three variables.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, write equations to represent the scales first. Then, solve the system of equations.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Make sure that your solution causes each scale to have the correct weight.

### Vocabulary

In math, an **_unknown_** is a letter that stands for a number that we do not yet know the value of. In this concept, the blocks that we did not know the weights of were **_unknowns_**. An **_equation_** is a math sentence that tells us two quantities that are equal. In this concept, we wrote **_equations_** with unknowns to represent what we saw on the scales. A **_system of equations_** is a set of equations that represents a given problem. Since we wrote multiple equations for each problem in this concept, we wrote a **_system of equations_** for each problem.

### Examples 

Write equations. Figure out the weights of the blocks.

#### Example 1

![0](media/848.png "Figure 6: $x + y + z = 22$; K: $x + x + y = 25$; $L: x + z + x+ z= 26$")

$x= 8, \  y = 9, \ z = 5$

#### Example 2

![0](media/849.png "Figure 7: M: $y + x + y + x = 32$; N:$z + z + x = 28$; P: $x+ y+ z = 25$")

### 8.5 Equal Costs

<article>

Carla and Dan went to the store. Carla bought 3 notebooks and a $2 pen. Dan bought 2 notebooks and an $8 stapler. All notebooks cost the same. They spent the same amount of money. Can you figure out the cost of one notebook? In this section, we will learn how to use equations to solve problems having to do with equal costs.

### Equal Costs 6

In order to answer questions about equal costs like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you know. What did each person buy?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to solve for the price of an item.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to write an expression for what each person spent. Then, set those expressions equal to each other since each person spent the same amount. Finally, solve the equation.
* Fourth, **solve**. Implement your plan.
* Fifth, **check**. Substitute your answer into the original problem and make sure it works.

#### Finding the Cost 

1. Al bought 2 sandwiches. Bob bought one sandwich and a $4 large soda. All sandwiches cost the same. They spent the same amount of money. What is the cost of one sandwich?

* Use $b$ to stand for the cost of one sandwich.

* Write an equation to represent the costs of the two people.

* Solve for the value of $b$.

* Show your work.

### 8.6 Rectangle Facts 6

<article>

Look at Rectangle $ABCD$ below. Notice that it has been divided into 4 smaller rectangles. Given the area of three of the smaller rectangles, can you figure out the area of the fourth? In this concept, we will practice working with the dimensions of rectangles and area of rectangles.

![0](media/857.png "Figure 1: ### Guidance")

In order to solve the problem about the rectangle above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the area of the fourth rectangle.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, figure out the dimensions of the square first. Then figure out the dimensions of the other rectangles. Finally, find the area of the missing rectangle.
* Then, **solve** the problem. Implement your plan.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Verify the dimensions and area of each rectangle.

### Vocabulary

A **_rectangle_** is a 4-sided shape whose angles are all right angles. The **_dimensions_** of a rectangle are the lengths of its sides (usually called the **_length_** and **_width_**). In general, **_area_** is a calculation of the number of unit squares it takes to fill up a shape.

### Vocabulary

One type of **_pattern_** is when the number of a certain object increases, decreases, or stays the same in a consistent way. In this concept, we saw patterns of tiles where the numbers of tiles were increasing. With any pattern you should be able to describe the pattern and how to get from one step of the pattern to the next. A **_rule_** is an equation that can describe a pattern. In this concept, we wrote **_rules_** for patterns that related the figure number to the number of tiles.

### Examples

### 8.8 Coin Stumpers

<article>

The weight of a pile of pennies and dimes is 142 grams. The total weight of the pennies is 50 grams. How many pennies and dimes are in the pile? In this section, we will learn how to reason proportionally to answer questions about coins.

### Coin Stumpers 

In order to answer the questions about coins like the one above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what you know from the information given.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to answer a question about the coins.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. Think about what other information you know about the weight of the coins. See if you can figure out the weight and number of each type of coin in the pile.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that your answer works with the original information given.

#### Weighing Coins

1. A pile of 100 pennies weighs 250 grams. A nickel weighs twice as much as a penny. What is the weight of a pile of 300 coins, half pennies and half nickels?

We can use problem solving steps to help.

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathbf{Describe:} && 100 \ \text{pennies weigh} \ 250 \ \text{grams.}\\
&&& \text{A nickel weighs twice as much as a penny.}\\
&&& \text{A new pile has} \ 300 \ \text{coins. Half of the} \ 300 \ \text{are pennies and half are nickels.}\\
\\
& \mathbf{My \ job:} && \text{Figure out the weight of the pile of} \ 300 \ \text{coins, half pennies and half nickels.}\\
\\
& \mathbf{Plan:} && \text{Compute the weight of a penny and a nickel. Then, use those weights to figure out}\\ &&& \text{the weight of the pile of} \ 300 \ \text{coins, half pennies and half nickels.}\\
\\
& \mathbf{Solve:} && 100 \ \text{pennies are} \ 250 \ \text{grams.}\\
&&& \text{So, one penny is} \ \frac{250}{100}, \ \text{or} \ 2.5 \ \text{grams.}\\
&&& \text{One nickel is} \ 2 \times 2.5, \ \text{or} \ 5 \ \text{grams.}\\
&&& 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \ \text{grams}\\
&&& 150 \times 5.0 = 750 \ \text{grams}\\
&&& \text{The pile of} \ 300 \ \text{coins is} \ 1125 \ \text{grams.}\\
\\
& \mathbf{Check:} && 100 \ \text{pennies are} \ 250 \ \text{grams. Using a proportion, the weight of} \ 150 \ \text{pennies is} \ 1.5\\
&&& \text{times} \ 250, \ \text{or} \ 375 \ \text{grams.}\\
&&& \text{Since} \ 100 \ \text{pennies are} \ 250 \ \text{grams}, \ 100 \ \text{nickels are} \ 2 \times 250 \ \text{or} \ 500 \ \text{grams. So}, \ 150\\
&&& \text{nickels are} \ 1.5 \times 500, \ \text{or} \ 750 \ \text{grams.}\\
&&& 375 + 750 = 1125 \ \text{grams}
\end{align*}
$$

We have already figured out the numbers of grams for a penny and a nickel. Next we will find the number of grams for a dime in Example B. Then we will use those weights to help with all of the other problems in this concept.

2. The weight of a pile of nickels and dimes is 273 grams. There are 60 coins in the pile. Fifty of the coins are nickels. What is the weight of a dime? Record that number in the list below.

![0](media/884.png)

\[Figure 1\] 

We can use problem solving steps to help.

**Describe:** 60 coins weigh 273 grams. 50 of the coins are nickels. The rest of the coins are dimes.

**My Job:** Figure out the weight of a dime and record it in the list.

**Plan:** I know the weight of a nickel is 5 grams. Figure out the weight of 50 nickels. Subtract that from the weight of 273 grams to find the weight of 10 dimes. Then, find the weight of one dime.

**Solve:** One nickel is 5 grams, so 50 nickels is $50 \times 5$ grams or 250 grams.

__Since the pile of 60 coins weighs 273 grams. $273-250=23$ grams is how much the 10 dimes weigh.__

One dime is $\frac{23 \ \text{grams}}{10}=2.3 \ \text{grams}$.

**Check:** 50 nickels: $5 \ \text{grams} \times 50=250 \ \text{grams}$

__10 dimes: $2.3  \ \text{grams} \times 10=23 \ \text{grams}$__

$250+23=273$

3. The weight of a pile of pennies and nickels is 300 grams. There are 20 nickels. How many pennies are there?

**Solution:**

We can use problem solving steps to help.

**Describe:** There is a pile of pennies and nickels that weighs 300 grams. There are 20 nickels.

**My Job:** Figure out how many pennies there are.

**Plan:** I know that a penny weighs 2.5 grams and a nickel weighs 5 grams. Find the weight of 20 nickels. Subtract that from 300 grams to find the weight of the pennies. Divide the weight of the pennies by 2.5 grams to find out how many pennies there are.

**Solve:** One nickel weighs 5 grams so 20 nickels weighs $20\times 5 \ \text{grams}=100 \ \text{grams}$.

__The pile is 300 grams, so that means that the pennies weigh $300  \ \text{grams}-100 \ \text{grams}=200 \ \text{grams}$.__

One penny weighs 2.5 grams. $\frac{200 \ \text{grams}}{2.5 \ \text{grams}}=80$ so 80 pennies weigh 200 grams. There are 80 pennies in the pile.

**Check:** 20 nickels: $5 \ \text{grams} \times 20=100 \ \text{grams}$

__80 pennies: $2.5  \ \text{grams} \times 80=200 \ \text{grams}$__

$100+200=300$

#### Earlier Problem Revisited

The weight of a pile of pennies and dimes is 142 grams. The total weight of the pennies is 50 grams. How many pennies and dimes are in the pile?

We can use the information from the examples and problem solving steps to help us solve this problem.

**Describe:** There is a pile of pennies and dimes that weighs 142 grams. The pennies weigh 50 grams.

**My Job:** Figure out how many pennies and dimes are in the pile.

**Plan:** Use the fact that the whole pile is 142 grams and the pennies are 50 grams to find the weight of the dimes. I know that a penny weighs 2.5 grams and a dime weighs 2.3 grams. Use this information to find out how many pennies and dimes there are.

**Solve:** $142 \ \text{grams}-50 \ \text{grams}=92 \ \text{grams}$ so the dimes weigh 92 grams.

__One penny weighs 2.5 grams. $\frac{50 \ \text{grams}}{2.5 \ \text{grams}}=20$ so there are 20 pennies.__

One dime weighs 2.3 grams. $\frac{92 \ \text{grams}}{2.3 \ \text{grams}}=40$ so there are 40 dimes.

**Check:** 20 pennies: $2.5 \ \text{grams} \times 20=50 \ \text{grams}$

__40 dimes: $2.3  \ \text{grams} \times 40=92 \ \text{grams}$__

$50+92=142$

### Vocabulary

In this concept we used **_proportional reasoning_** when we used what we knew about a pile of coins to figure out information about one coin. Any time there is a constant ratio between two quantities (such as the number of pennies in a pile and the weight of the pile) we can use **_proportional reasoning_** to solve.

### Examples 

#### Example 1

The total weight of a pile of pennies, nickels, and dimes is 191.4 grams. There are 20 pennies in the pile. There are 2 fewer dimes than pennies. How many coins are nickels?

20 nickels

20 pennies are $20 \times 2.5$ grams $= 50$ grams; 18 dimes are $18 \times 2.3$ grams $= 41.4$ grams. $191.4 - 91.4 = 100$ grams 

$\frac{100}{5} = 20$ nickels.

#### Example 2

The total weight of a pile of pennies and dimes is 96 grams. There are 20 dimes in the pile. What is the total value of the coins?

$2.20

20 dimes is $20 \times 2.3$ grams, or 46 grams

$96 - 46 = 50$ grams

$\frac{50}{2.5} = 20$ pennies 

20 dimes is $2.00

20 pennies is $0.20

$\$2 + \$0.20 = \$2.20$

#### Example 3

The total weight of a pile of nickels and pennies is 3000 grams. The total value of the nickels is $25. How many pennies are in the pile?

200 pennies

$\$25 \times 20$ nickels/dollar $= 500$ nickels  
$500 \times 5$ grams $= 2500$ grams of nickels

$3000 - 2500 = 500$ grams of pennies

$\frac{500}{2.5} = 200$ pennies

### Review 

1.  A pile of pennies, nickels and dimes weighs 146 grams. There are 30 pennies in the pile. There are 10 less dimes than pennies. What is the total value of the nickels in the pile?
2.  A pile of pennies, nickels and dimes weighs 195.5 grams. There are 15 pennies in the pile. There are 12 more nickels than pennies. What is the total value of the coins in the pile?
3.  The total weight of a pile of pennies, nickels, and dimes is 84.6 grams. There are 22 pennies in the pile. There are 20 fewer dimes than pennies. How many coins are nickels?
4.  The total weight of a pile of pennies and nickels is 142.5 grams. There are 15 nickels in the pile. What is the total value of the coins?
5.  The total weight of a pile of nickels and dimes is 1273.1 grams. The total value of the nickels is $10.50. How many dimes are in the pile?

### 8.9 Trip Functions

<article>

Read the facts below and look at the table. Can you complete the table to show changes in Ms. Wilson's odometer? Can you write a rule that shows the relationship between the number of hours and the odometer reading? In this section, we will learn to write rules for information given about trips.

**Facts:** Before the start of the cross-country trip, the odometer in Mrs. Wilson’s car showed 4,100 miles. On the trip, she averaged 50 miles per hour.

![0](media/885.png "Figure 1: ### Trip Functions ")

In order to make a table and write a rule for situations like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you know. What did the odometer say at the beginning? How much is it changing each hour?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to make a table and write a rule.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the facts to fill in the table. Then, look for a pattern to help you write the rule.
* Fourth, **solve**. Implement your plan.
* Fifth, **check**. Make sure your rule works with the facts.

**1. Facts:** Before he left on his trip, Mr. Patterson’s truck odometer showed 23,500 miles. He averaged 40 miles per hour on his drive from Sacramento to San Diego.

### Vocabulary

One type of **_table_** shows a relationship between an **_input_** and an **_output_**. In this concept, the inputs of our tables were _number of hours_ and the outputs of our tables were _odometer: number of miles._ A **_rule_** is an equation that can describe the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a table. In this concept, we wrote **_rules_** that showed the relationship between the number of hours and the odometer or pedometer reading.

### Examples

### 8.10 Drive Away

<article>

Look at the fact and graph below. Can you figure out what Bush's speed was in miles per hour? Can you complete a table to show the total number of miles traveled by Bush at that speed? Can you write a rule to show how the number of miles is related to the number of hours? In this section, we will learn how to interpret graphs and write rules to match what we see on graphs.

Fact: The graph shows the speeds of drivers, Axel and Bush, on city roads. Bush is traveling faster than Axel.

![0](media/904.png "Figure 1: ### Drive Away ")

In order to make a table and write a rule for situations like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you know. What information do we see in the graph?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to make a table and write a rule.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the graph to fill in the table. Then, look for a pattern to help you write the rule.
* Fourth, **solve**. Implement your plan.
* Fifth, **check**. Make sure your rule works with the graph.

1. Fact: The graph shows the speeds of drivers, Harold and French. Harold didn’t travel as fast as French.

![0](media/905.png "Figure 2: 1.  What was Harold’s speed in miles per hour?")

3.  Let $t$ represent number of hours and $D$ represent distance in number of miles. Write a rule to show how the number of miles $(D)$ is related to number of hours $(t)$.

We can use problem solving steps to help us to interpret the graph and answer the questions.

### Vocabulary

A **_graph_** is one way to show the relationship between two variables. In this concept, we looked at graphs that showed the relationship between distance and time. A **_table_** is another way to show a relationship between two variables (often thought of as the **_input_** and the **_output_**). In this concept, the inputs of our tables were _number of hours_ and the outputs of our tables were _number of miles._ A **_rule_** is an equation that can describe the relationship between the variables in a graph or a table. In this concept, we wrote **_rules_** that showed the relationship between the number of hours and the number of miles.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Fact: The graph shows the speeds of drivers, Marx and Stevens. Marx drove 5 mph faster than Stevens.

Introduction
------------

In these concepts, you will continue to develop eight key concepts of algebra and will practice your problem solving skills. There are eight concepts, and each one focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. You will focus on describing, identifying your job, planning, solving, and checking your thinking.

### 9.1 X for Unknown

<article>

Look at the equation below. Can you figure out the value of $x$? In this section, you will learn how to solve equations using the order of operations, distributive property, and square roots.

$$
2(x + 8) + 2x = x(x + 2^2) + 3^2 - 9
$$

### X for Unknown 

The **order of operations** tells us the correct order of evaluating math expressions. We always do **_parentheses first_**. Then we do **_exponents_**. Next we do **_multiplication and division (from left to right)_** and finally **_addition and subtraction (from left to right)_**. The **_distributive property $(a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c)$_** allows us to remove parentheses when there is an unknown inside of them.

In order to evaluate expressions using the distributive property and the order of operations, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the problem. What operations are there?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to solve for the unknown.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the distributive property and the order of operations to get the $x^2$ by itself. At the end, you will use a square root.
* Fourth, **solve**.
* Fifth, **check**. Substitute your answer into the equation and make sure it works.

### Vocabulary

The **_order of operations_** tells us the correct order of evaluating math expressions. We always do **_parentheses first_**. Then we do **_exponents_**. Next we do **_multiplication and division (from left to right)_** and finally **_addition and subtraction (from left to right)_**. The **_distributive property $(a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c)$_** allows us to remove parentheses when there is an unknown inside of them. The **_square root_** of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.

### Examples

Solve for the positive value of $x$. Show all steps.

#### Example 1

$x^2 + 6(x - 1) = 2(3x - 2) + 2^2 - 2$

$x=2$. Here are the steps to solve: 



$$
\ \quad x^2 + 6(x - 1) = 2(3x - 2) + 2^2 - 2\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 6x - 6 = 6x - 4 + 2^2 - 2\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 6x - 6 = 6x - 4 + 4 - 2\!\\ 
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 6x - 6 - 6x = 6x - 4 + 4 - 2 - 6x\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 + -6 = - 4 + 4 - 2\!\\ 
{\;} \qquad x^2 + -6 = - 2\!\\ 
{\;} \qquad x^2 + -6 + 6 = - 2 + 6\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 = 4\!\\
{\;} \qquad x = 2
$$

#### Example 2

$x^2 + 4(x + 1) = 2(2x +  3^2) + 11$

$x=5$. Here are the steps to solve:  

$$
\quad \  x^2 + 4(x + 1) = 2(2x + 3^2) + 11\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 4x + 4 = 4x + 2 \times 9 + 11\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 4x + 4 - 4x = 4x + 2 \times 9 + 11 - 4x \!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 4 = 2 \times 9 + 11\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 4  = 18 + 11\!\\ 
{\;} \qquad x^2 + 4 - 4 = 18 + 11 - 4\!\\
{\;} \qquad x^2 = 25\!\\
{\;} \qquad x = 5
$$

#### Example 3

$3(x + 10) - 1 - 2^2 =  3x + x^2 + 2(3 + 5)$

$x=3$. Here are the steps to solve:



$$
\quad \  3(x + 10) - 1 - 2^2 = 3x + x^2 + 2(3 + 5)\!\\ 
{\;} \qquad 3x + 30 - 1 - 2^2 = 3x + x^2 + 2 \times 8\!\\ 
{\;} \qquad 3x + 30 - 1 - 4 = 3x + x^2 + 2 \times 8\!\\ 
{\;} \qquad 3x + 30 - 1 - 4 - 3x = 3x + x^2 + 2 \times 8 - 3x \!\\
{\;} \qquad 30 - 1 - 4 = x^2 + 2 \times 8\!\\  
{\;} \qquad 30 - 1 - 4 = x^2 + 16\!\\  
{\;} \qquad 25 = x^2 + 16\!\\
{\;} \qquad 25 - 16 = x^2 + 16 - 16\!\\   
{\;} \qquad 9 = x^2\!\\
{\;} \qquad 3 = x
$$

### Review 

Solve for the positive value of $x$. Show all steps.

1.  $x^2-4(x-3)=4(2x-1)+3^2-1-4x$
2.  $2x^2+7(x-5)=3x+4(x-9)+2^2+x^2+1$
3.  $x^2+5(2x+1)=2(5x+2^2)+22$
4.  $6(x-5)+13+3^2=6x+x^2-4(1+2)$
5.  $x^2-4(2x+6)=1-8x$
6.  $2(4x-3)+4^2-12=10x+x^2-2(1+x)$
7.  $3x^2+4(x-3)=2(2x+x^2)+24$
8.  $2(x-5)+16-2^3=x^2-7x+9(x-3)$

### 9.2 Letter Grids

<article>

Look at the picture below. The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Can you figure out the value of each of the five letters? In this section, we will practice solving for unknowns in circles and arrows diagrams.

![0](media/920.png "Figure 1: ### Letter Grids ")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what you see in the diagram.
* Next, figure out what **your job** is in this problem. In all of these problems your job will be to figure out the value of the four letters in the diagram.
* Then, make a **plan** for how you will solve. There is usually more than one way to solve the problem. In some of these problems you might need to find the sum of three letters first in order to find the value of one letter.
* Next, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** to make sure that the values you found work for the rows or the columns.

#### Finding Unknown Values

### Vocabulary

In math, an **_unknown_** is a letter that stands for a number that we do not yet know the value of. In this concept, when you figured out the value of the letters in the circles and arrows diagrams you were solving for **_unknowns._**

### Examples

In all problems, letters stand for numbers, same letters are same numbers, numbers in squares are row and column sums, arrows point to the sums. Find the values of the five letters.

#### Example 1

### 9.3 Hanging Scales 7

<article>

Look at the pictures of the scales below. Can you write equations to represent what you see on each scale? Can you figure out the value of each letter? In this section, we will practice working with equations that represent what we see on scales. We will then practice solving these systems of equations.

![0](media/933.png "Figure 1: ### Hanging Scales 7 ")

In order to solve the problem above, use the problem solving steps.

* Start by **describing** what information is given.
* Then, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the value of each of the four variables.
* Next, make a **plan** for how you will solve. In these problems, write equations to represent the scales first. Then, solve the system of equations.
* Then, **solve** the problem.
* Finally, **check** your solution. Make sure that your solution causes each scale to have the correct weight.

### Vocabulary

In math, an **_unknown_** is a letter that stands for a number that we do not yet know the value of. In this concept, the blocks that we did not know the weights of were **_unknowns_**. An **_equation_** is a math sentence that tells us two quantities that are equal. In this concept, we wrote **_equations_** with unknowns to represent what we saw on the scales. A **_system of equations_** is a set of equations that represent a given problem. Since we wrote multiple equations for each problem in this concept, we wrote a **_system of equations_** for each problem.

### Examples

Write equations. Figure out the weights of the blocks.

#### Example 1

![0](media/938.png "Figure 6: A: $x + x + z = 26$; B: $w + x + z = 23$; C: $x + z + x + z = 34$; D: $w + y + y = 20$")

$w = 6$ pounds, $x = 9$ pounds, $y = 7$ pounds, $z = 8$ pounds 

#### Example 2

![0](media/939.png "Figure 7: A: $y + x + y + x = 26$, B: $x + y + w = 17$; C: $w + x + x = 20$; D: $w + x + y + z = 26$")

$w = 4$ pounds, $x = 8$ pounds, $y = 5$ pounds, $z = 9$ pounds

#### Example 1

![0](media/940.png "Figure 8: A: $w + y + z = 22$; B: $x + y + z + z = 25$; C: $x + y + z = 20$; D: $w + z + w + z = 26$.")

__$w = 8$ pounds, $x = 6$ pounds, $y = 9$ pounds, $z = 5$ pounds.__

$w = 8$ pounds, $x = 6$ pounds, $y = 9$ pounds, $z = 5$ pounds.

### Review 

Write equations. Figure out the weights of the blocks. Same blocks weigh the same.

&&& t = 69.7 \ sec\\
&&& \text{it would take about} \ 1 \ minute .\\
\\

### Vocabulary

**_Rate_** is another word for the speed of an object. **_Rate_** tells us the distance that an object is traveling in a given amount of time. The formula **_$D=rt$_** shows the relationship between **_Distance, rate_**, and **_time_**.

### Examples

Use the $\textbf{D= \textit{rt}}$ formula to solve these problems. Show your steps.

#### Example 1

One of the fastest swimmers swam 100 yards at the rate of 6.65 feet per second. How long did it take the swimmer to swim the 100 yards?

About 45 seconds. 

$$
\begin{align*}
D&= rt\\
100 \ yards &= 300 \ ft\\
300 \ ft &= 6.65 \ ft/sec \times \textbf{\textit{t}}\\
\frac{300 \ ft}{6.65 \ ft/sec} &= \textbf{\textit{t}}\\
45.11 \ sec &= t
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 2

A hard hit table tennis ball can travel the length of the 9 foot table in 0.075 second. At that speed, how far would the table tennis ball travel in one second?

120 ft/sec

$$
\begin{align*}
D&= rt\\
9 \ ft &= \textbf{\textit{r}} \times 0.075 \ sec\\
\frac{9 \ ft}{0.075 \ sec} & = \textbf{\textit{r}}\\
120 \ ft/sec &= \textbf{\textit{r}}
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 3

In 0.3 second, a well hit volley ball can travel 59 feet, the length of a volley ball court. How far could a hard hit volleyball travel in one second?



196.7 ft/sec

$$
\begin{align*}
D&= rt\\
59 \ ft &= \textbf{\textit{r}} \times 0.3 \ sec\\
\frac{59 \ ft}{0.3 \ sec} &= \textbf{\textit{r}}\\
196.7 \ ft/sec &= \textbf{\textit{r}}
\end{align*}
$$

### Review 

Use the $\textbf{D= \textit{rt}}$ formula to solve these problems. Show your steps.

1.  A swimmer swims 150 yards at the rate of 2.8 feet per second. How long did it take the swimmer to swim the 150 yards?
2.  A baseball travels 80 mph. At that speed, how far would it travel in three seconds? Determine your answer in feet.

### 9.5 Lines of Numbers

<article>

Look at the pattern below. How would you describe it? Can you answer the questions about the pattern? In this section, we will practice working with number patterns.

![0](media/947.png "Figure 1: ### Lines of Numbers ")

In order to examine patterns and answer questions about patterns like the ones above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you see in the pattern. What numbers are there? When does it start repeating?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to answer the questions.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to figure out how many times the pattern repeats before reaching the given number.
* Fourth, **solve**. Answer the questions.
* Fifth, **check**. Make sure that your answers are correct.

1. Look at the pattern below and answer the questions.

![0](media/948.png "Figure 2: We can use problem solving steps to help us answer the questions about the pattern.")

**Describe:** The number pattern keeps repeating the numbers 1, 2 3, 4.

**My Job:** Figure out the 25_th_ and 75_th_ numbers and the sum of the first 75 numbers.

**Plan:** The numbers are in sets of four: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Find how many sets of four numbers there are and how many numbers are left over to find the 25_th_ and 75_th_ numbers. To find the sum of the first 75 numbers, multiply the number of sets of four numbers by the sum of the four numbers. Then add in the left over numbers.

**Solve:** a. $25 \div 4$ is 6 with 1 left over and $4 \times 6 =24$. So, the 24_th_ number will be 4 (the last number in the set). Therefore, the 25_th_ number will be 1.

____b. $75 \div 4$ is 18 with 3 left over and $4 \times 18=72$. So, the 72_nd_ number will be 4, the 73_rd_ number will be 1, the 74_th_ number will be 2, and the 75_th_ number will be 3.__

b. $75 \div 4$ is 18 with 3 left over and $4 \times 18=72$. So, the 72_nd_ number will be 4, the 73_rd_ number will be 1, the 74_th_ number will be 2, and the 75_th_ number will be 3.__

__c. 10 is the sum of one set of 1, 2, 3, 4. There are 18 sets of four numbers ending with 72. $10 \times 18=180$ is the sum of the first 72 numbers. $1+2+3=6$ is the sum of the three left over numbers. So, $180+6=186$ is the sum of the first 75 numbers in the pattern.__

c. 10 is the sum of one set of 1, 2, 3, 4. There are 18 sets of four numbers ending with 72. $10 \times 18=180$ is the sum of the first 72 numbers. $1+2+3=6$ is the sum of the three left over numbers. So, $180+6=186$ is the sum of the first 75 numbers in the pattern.

**Check:** a. The 1_st_, 5_th_, 9_th_, and so forth numbers are 1s. All positions one more than a multiple of 4 are 1s. So the 25_th_ number is 1.

____b. 73 is one more than a multiple of 4, so the 73_rd_ number is 1, the 74_th_ number is 2, and the 75_th_ number is 3.__

b. 73 is one more than a multiple of 4, so the 73_rd_ number is 1, the 74_th_ number is 2, and the 75_th_ number is 3.__

__c. There are 18 sets of 4 in 75, with three left over. The sum of the first 18 sets of four numbers is $10\times 18=180$ and the sum of the three extra numbers is 6, so the total sum is 186.__

c. There are 18 sets of 4 in 75, with three left over. The sum of the first 18 sets of four numbers is $10\times 18=180$ and the sum of the three extra numbers is 6, so the total sum is 186.

2. Look at the pattern below and answer the questions.

We can use problem solving steps to help us answer the questions about the pattern.

**Describe:** The number pattern keeps repeating the numbers 2, 3, 4.

**My Job:** Figure out the 40_th_ and 110_th_ numbers and the sum of the first 110 numbers.

**Plan:** The numbers are in sets of three: 2, 3, and 4. Find how many sets of three numbers there are and how many numbers are left over to find the 40_th_ and 110_th_ numbers. To find the sum of the first 110 numbers, multiply the number of sets of three numbers by the sum of the three numbers. Then add in the left over numbers.

**Solve:** a. $40 \div 3$ is 13 with 1 left over and $3 \times 13 =39$. So, the 39_th_ number will be 4 (the last number in the set). Therefore, the 40_th_ number will be 2.

____b. $110 \div 3$ is 36 with 2 left over and $3 \times 36=108$. So, the 108_th_ number will be 4. The 109_th_ number will be 2, and the 110_th_ number will be 3.__

b. $110 \div 3$ is 36 with 2 left over and $3 \times 36=108$. So, the 108_th_ number will be 4. The 109_th_ number will be 2, and the 110_th_ number will be 3.__

__c. 9 is the sum of one set of 2, 3, 4. There are 36 sets of three numbers ending with 108. $9 \times 36=324$ is the sum of the first 108 numbers. $2+3=5$ is the sum of the two left over numbers. So, $324+5=329$ is the sum of the first 110 numbers in the pattern.__

c. 9 is the sum of one set of 2, 3, 4. There are 36 sets of three numbers ending with 108. $9 \times 36=324$ is the sum of the first 108 numbers. $2+3=5$ is the sum of the two left over numbers. So, $324+5=329$ is the sum of the first 110 numbers in the pattern.

**Check:** a. The 1_st_, 4_th_, 7_th_, and so forth numbers are 2s. All positions one more than a multiple of 3 are 2s. So the 40_th_ number is 2.

____b. 109 is one more than a multiple of 3, so the 109_th_ number is 2 and the 110_th_ number is 3.__

b. 109 is one more than a multiple of 3, so the 109_th_ number is 2 and the 110_th_ number is 3.__

__c. There are 36 sets of 3 in 110, with two left over. The sum of the first 36 sets of three numbers is $9\times 36=324$ and the sum of the two extra numbers is 5, so the total sum is 329.__

c. There are 36 sets of 3 in 110, with two left over. The sum of the first 36 sets of three numbers is $9\times 36=324$ and the sum of the two extra numbers is 5, so the total sum is 329.

**Describe:** The number pattern keeps repeating the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7.

**My Job:** Figure out the 70_th_ and 175_th_ numbers and the sum of the first 175 numbers.

**Plan:** The numbers are in sets of four: 1, 3, 5, and 7. Find how many sets of four numbers there are and how many numbers are left over to find the 70_th_ and 175_th_ numbers. To find the sum of the first 175 numbers, multiply the number of sets of four numbers by the sum of the four numbers. Then add in the left over numbers.

**Solve:** a. $70 \div 4$ is 17 with 2 left over and $4 \times 17 =68$. So, the 68_th_ number will be 7 (the last number in the set). Therefore, the 69_th_ number will be 1, and the 70_th_ number will be 3.

____b. $175 \div 4$ is 43 with 3 left over and $4 \times 43=172$. So, the 172_nd_ number will be 7, the 173_rd_ number will be 1, the 174_th_ number will be 3, and the 175_th_ number will be 5.__

b. $175 \div 4$ is 43 with 3 left over and $4 \times 43=172$. So, the 172_nd_ number will be 7, the 173_rd_ number will be 1, the 174_th_ number will be 3, and the 175_th_ number will be 5.__

__c. 16 is the sum of one set of 1, 3, 5, 7. There are 43 sets of four numbers ending with 172. $16 \times 43=688$ is the sum of the first 172 numbers. $1+3+5=9$ is the sum of the three left over numbers. So, $688+9=697$ is the sum of the first 175 numbers in the pattern.__

c. 16 is the sum of one set of 1, 3, 5, 7. There are 43 sets of four numbers ending with 172. $16 \times 43=688$ is the sum of the first 172 numbers. $1+3+5=9$ is the sum of the three left over numbers. So, $688+9=697$ is the sum of the first 175 numbers in the pattern.

**Check:** a. The 1_st_, 5_th_, 9_th_, and so forth numbers are 1s. All positions one more than a multiple of 4 are 1s. So the 69_th_ number is 1 and the 70_th_ number is 3.

**Describe:** The number pattern keeps repeating the numbers 3, 4, and 4.

**My Job:** Figure out the 50_th_ and 200_th_ numbers and the sum of the first 200 numbers.

**Plan:** The numbers are in sets of three: 3, 4, and 4. Find how many sets of three numbers there are and how many numbers are left over to find the 50_th_ and 200_th_ numbers. To find the sum of the first 200 numbers, multiply the number of sets of three numbers by the sum of the three numbers. Then add in the left over numbers.

**Solve:** a. $50 \div 3$ is 16 with 2 left over and $3 \times 16 =48$. So, the 48_th_ number will be 4 (the last number in the set). Therefore, the 49_th_ number will be 3, and the 50_th_ number will be 4.

____b. $200 \div 3$ is 66 with 2 left over and $3 \times 66=198$. So, the 198_th_ number will be 4. The 199_th_ number will be 3, and the 200_th_ number will be 4.__

b. $200 \div 3$ is 66 with 2 left over and $3 \times 66=198$. So, the 198_th_ number will be 4. The 199_th_ number will be 3, and the 200_th_ number will be 4.__

__c. 11 is the sum of one set of 3, 4, 4. There are 66 sets of three numbers ending with 198. $11 \times 66=726$ is the sum of the first 198 numbers. $3+4=7$ is the sum of the two left over numbers. So, $726+7=733$ is the sum of the first 200 numbers in the pattern.__

c. 11 is the sum of one set of 3, 4, 4. There are 66 sets of three numbers ending with 198. $11 \times 66=726$ is the sum of the first 198 numbers. $3+4=7$ is the sum of the two left over numbers. So, $726+7=733$ is the sum of the first 200 numbers in the pattern.

**Check:** a. The 1_st_, 4_th_, 7_th_, and so forth numbers are 3s. All positions one more than a multiple of 3 are 3s. So the 49_th_ number is 3 and the 50_th_ number is 4.

____b. 199 is one more than a multiple of 3, so the 199_th_ number is 3 and the 200_th_ number is 4.__

b. 199 is one more than a multiple of 3, so the 199_th_ number is 3 and the 200_th_ number is 4.__

__c. There are 66 sets of 3 in 200, with two left over. The sum of the first 66 sets of three numbers is $11\times 6=726$ and the sum of the two extra numbers is 7, so the total sum is 733.__

c. There are 66 sets of 3 in 200, with two left over. The sum of the first 66 sets of three numbers is $11\times 6=726$ and the sum of the two extra numbers is 7, so the total sum is 733.

### Vocabulary

One type of **_pattern_** is when a set of objects repeats over and over. In this concept, we saw patterns of numbers where sets of numbers repeated to form a pattern. With any pattern you should be able to describe the pattern and how to get from one step of the pattern to the next.

### Examples

Look at each pattern and answer the questions.

#### Example 1

![0](media/952.png "Figure 6: a. the 47th number is 8. $47\div 3$ is 15 with two left over. So, the 45th number is 9, the 46th number is 7, and the 47th number is 8.")

b. The 100th number is 7. $100 \div 3$ is 33 with 1 left over. So, the 99th number is 9 and the 100th number is 7.

c. The sum of the first 100 numbers is 809. The sum of one set of 7, 8, 9 is 24. From the answer to question b, we know that 33 sets of three numbers ends with 99. The sum of the first 99 numbers is $33\times 24=802$. The 100th number is 7, so the sum of the first 100 numbers in the pattern is $802+7=809$. 

#### Example 2

![0](media/953.png "Figure 7: a. The 27th number is 6. $27 \div 4$ is 6 with three left over. So , the 24th number is 8, the 25th number is 4, the 26th number is 4, and the 27th number is 6")

b. The 78th number is 4. $78 \div 4$ is 19 with 2 left over. So, the 76th number is 8, the 77th number is 4, and the 78th number is 4.

c. The sum of the first 78 numbers is 426. The sum of one set of 4, 4, 6 and 8 is 22. From the answer to question b, we know that 19 sets of four numbers ends with 76. The sum of the first 76 numbers is $19\times 22=418$. The two left over numbers are 4 and 4, and their sum is 8. So the sum of the first 78 numbers in the pattern is $19\times 22=418$.  

#### Example 3

![0](media/954.png "Figure 8: a. The 38_th_ number is 3. $38\div 4$ is 9 with two left over. So, the 36_th_ number is 7, the 37_th_ number is 1, and the 38_th_ number is 3.")

b. The 72nd number is 7. $72 \div 4$ is 18 with none left over. So, so 72nd number is 7.

c. The sum of the first 72 numbers is 288. The sum of one set of 1, 3, 5, 7 is 16. From the answer to question b, we know that 18 sets of four numbers ends with 72. The sum of the first 72 numbers is $16 \times 18=288$.

### 9.6 Fruit Confusion

<article>

Look at the picture of the bananas and the information about the price of bananas below. Can you figure out how much just one banana would cost? In this section, we will use proportions and logical reasoning to determine the cost of individual items given information about multiples of those items.

![0](media/961.png "Figure 1: ### Fruit Confusion ")

In order to answer a question about the cost of an item like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you know. What do we know about the weight of the fruit? What do we know about the cost of the fruit?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to figure out the cost or weight of one piece/pound of fruit. Or, it might be to figure out how many pieces of fruit are in a closed box.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to write a proportion that relates the weight of the fruit to the cost. Solve the proportion and use logical reasoning to answer the question that was asked.
* Fourth, **solve**. Implement your plan.
* Fifth, **check**. Check your answer by verifying that it works with all of the original information.

### Vocabulary

A **_proportion_** is an equation that states that two ratios are equal. In this concept, we can use **_proportions_** because the ratio of weight to cost is constant for each type of fruit. As long as we know the cost of fruit for a particular weight of that fruit, we can find the cost of that fruit for any weight of that fruit using **_proportions._**

### Examples

#### Example 1

![0](media/966.png "Figure 6: $\$0.05; \frac{3\ pounds}{\$ 1.20} = \frac{1.5\ pounds}{x \ dollars}$, so $x = \$0.60$, and $\$0.60 \div 12 = \$0.05$.")

#### Example 2

![0](media/967.png "Figure 7: $10; \frac{3\ pounds}{\$ 0.90} = \frac{4\ pounds}{x \ dollars}$, so $x$ is $\$1.20$, and $\$1.20 \div \$0.12$ is 10.")

#### Example 3

![0](media/968.png "Figure 8: $21; \frac{4\ pounds}{\$ 5.04} = \frac{5\ pounds}{x \ dollars}$, so $x = \$6.30$, and $\$6.30 \div \$0.30 = 21$")

### Vocabulary

One type of **_table_** shows a relationship between an **_input_** and an **_output_**. In this concept, the inputs of our tables were _number of scoops_ and the outputs of our tables were _total cost._ A **_rule_** is an equation that can describe the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a table. In this concept, we wrote **_rules_** that showed the relationship between the number of scoops and the total cost.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Yaley's sells yogurt chocolate cups.

### 9.8 Pedal Power

<article>

Read the fact and analyze the graph below. Can you complete a table for each biker showing the distance they traveled? Can you write a function to show the relationship between the number of miles traveled $(D)$ and number of hours $(t)$ traveled for each biker? In this section, we will practice writing functions from graphs.

Fact: Judson left on the bike hike one hour after Connor and biked at a faster speed than Connor.

### Pedal Power 

In order to make a table and write a function for situations like the one above, we can use the problem solving steps to help.

* First, **describe** what you know. What information do we see in the graph?
* Second, identify what **your job** is. In these problems, your job will be to make a table and write a function.
* Third, make a **plan**. In these problems, your plan should be to use the graph to fill in the table. Then, look for a pattern to help you write the function.
* Fourth, **solve**. Implement your plan.
* Fifth, **check**. Make sure your function works with the graph.

### Vocabulary

A **_graph_** is one way to show the relationship between two variables. In this concept, we looked at graphs that showed the relationship between distance and time. A **_table_** is another way to show a relationship between two variables (often thought of as the **_input_** and the **_output_**). In this concept, the inputs of our tables were _number of hours_ and the outputs of our tables were _number of miles._ A **_rule_** or **_function_** is an equation that can describe the relationship between the variables in a graph or a table. In this concept, we wrote **_functions_** that showed the relationship between the number of hours and the number of miles.
